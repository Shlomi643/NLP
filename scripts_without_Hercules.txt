dorado his story gripped the world oil billionaire miles axlerod in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without gps ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild mel dorado feared dead he emerged 36 days later running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements since then he's sold his oil fortune converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable clean-burning fuel 15 mel dorado now he claims to have done it with his allinol mel dorado and to show the world what his new superfuel can do he's created a racing competition like no other inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever world grand prix welcome sir miles axlerod miles axlerod thank you mel it is very good to be here now listen to me: big oil it costs a fortune pollution is getting worse i mean come on it's a fossil fuel fossil as in dead dinosaurs and we all know what happened to them alternative energy is the future trust me mel after seeing allinol in action at the world grand prix nobody will ever go back to gasoline again what happened to the dinosaurs now mel dorado and on satellite a world grand prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world francesco bernoulli francesco it is an honor signore dorado for you 16 mel dorado miles why not invite lightning mcqueen miles axlerod of course we invited him but apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest francesco lightning mcqueen would not have a chance against francesco francesco i can go over 300 kilometers an hour in miles that is like uh way faster than mcqueen mel dorado let's go to the phones baltimore maryland you're on the air caller am i on hello mel dorado you're on go ahead caller hello mel dorado go ahead caller mel dorado let's go to radiator springs you're on caller mater's voice yeah that italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about lightning mcqueen he's the bestest race car in the whole wide world 17 uh-oh francesco if he is how you say "the bestest race car " then why must he rest eh mater's voice cause he knows what's important every now and then he prefers just to slow down enjoy life francesco ah you heard it lightning mcqueen prefers to be slow of course this is not news to francesco when i want to go to sleep i watch one of his races after two laps i am out cold mater's voice that ain't what i meant hey what's going on over there cut back to: oh it's that italian formula car his name is --- francesco bernoulli no wonder there's a crowd wait why do you know his name and don't say it like that it's three syllables not ten 18 what he's nice to look at you know open-wheeled and all what's wrong with fenders i thought you like my fenders mater's voice well let me tell you something else there mr san francisco --- mater mater's voice mcqueen could drive circles around you francesco driving in circles is all he can do no mater's voice no i mean yes i mean he could beat you anywhere anytime any track francesco mel can we move on francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation like a dump truck ha ha that shows what you know dump trucks is dumb mcqueen yeah hi this is lightning mcqueen look i don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that 19 francesco mcqueen that was your best friend this is the difference between you and francesco francesco knows how good he is he does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it those are strong words from a car that is so fragile francesco fragilé he calls francesco fragilé not so fast mcqueen "not so fast " what is that your new motto miles axlerod well this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course what do you say lightning mcqueen we've still got room for one more racer well i would love to the only thing is my crew's off for the season so --- pit stop you know what they just got back deal me in baby ka-chow 20 i know i know i just got back but we won't be long and --- oh no don't worry about me i've got enough to do here mater's going to have a blast though you're bringing mater right you never bring him to any of your races just let him sit in the pits give him a headset c'mon it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him your drinks sir mater

is gonna flip when she sees this she's lightning mcqueen's girlfriend oooh 24 she's a big fan of yours hey she has good taste mater's prone to exaggeration i wouldn't say she's a "big" fan you're right she's a huge fan she goes on and on about your open wheels here mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on " francesco is familiar with this reaction to francesco women respect a car that has nothing to hide yeah uh let us have a toast let's i dedicate my win tomorrow to miss sally oh sorry i already dedicated my win tomorrow to her so if we both do it it's really not so special besides i don't have a drink i'll go get you one you mind if i borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks 25 they're free mater free well shoot what am i doing here i should probably go keep an eye on him see you at the race yes you will see francesco but not like this you will see him like this as he drives away from you that's cute so you had one of those made up for all the racers no okay he is

satellites the americans actually discovered it just before you did they placed an agent on that platform under deep cover he was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation who is it has anyone seen the photo yet no not yet the american is here tonight to pass it to you he'll signal you when he's ready oh no what is it change of plan you're meeting the american what me 28

beetles you had your type-3 squarebacks with the pancake motors yeah okay i get it--- and before both of them there's the type-2 buses - my buddy fillmore's one of them 36 listen we should find somewhere more private uh gee don't you think that's a little uh --- you're right impossible to know which areas here are compromised so when can i see you again well let's see tomorrow i'll be out there at the races got it we'll rendezvous then there you are where have you been what's a rendezvous it's like a date a date mater what's going on well what's going on is i've got me a date tomorrow guido don't believe you well believe it my new girlfriend just said so hey there she is 37 hey hey lady see ya tomorrow guido still don't believe you grem i gotta admit --- --- you tricked us real good and we don't like being tricked hey what's so funny well you know i was just wearing a disguise you guys are stuck looking like that allinol thanks fellas i hear this stuff is good for you 38 professor zundapp so you think allinol by itself is good for you but after microscopic examination i have found that it has one small weakness when hit with an electromagnetic pulse it becomes extremely dangerous --- for the camera is that all you want i got a whole act you were very interested in this camera on the oil platform now you will witness what it really does whatever you say professor you talked up a lot of cars last night which one's your associate your mother oh no i'm sorry it was your sister you know i can't tell them apart these days 39 could i start it now professor fifty percent power this camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter what about her did you give it to her the allinol is now heating to a boil dramatically expanding causing the engine block to crack under the stress forcing oil into the combustion chamber how about him you talk to him what do i care i can replace an engine block you may be able to but after full impact of the pulse unfortunately there will be nothing to replace how about him does he have it that's him he's the one roger that professor z 40 no professor zundapp yes sir we believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information i will take care of it before any damage can be done the project is still on schedule you will find this second agent --- --- and kill him brent mustangburger japan land of the rising sun where ancient tradition meets modern technology welcome to the inaugural running of the world grand prix i'm brent mustangburger here with racing legends darrell cartrip and david hobbscap there's never been a competition like this before brent mustangburger first allinol making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions 41 brent mustangburger second the course itself and it's like nothing we've ever seen david how exactly does this competition work david hobbscap well brent all three of these street courses are classic round- the-house racetracks david hobbscap this means that the lmp and formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion david hobbscap look for francesco bernoulli in particular to lead early david hobbscap and with a series of technical turns throughout --- david hobbscap gt and touring cars like spain's miguel camino should make up some ground but i doubt it'll be enough to stop francesco from absolutely running away with it darrell cartrip woah now just hold your horsepower you're forgetting the most important factor here that early dirt track section of the course the dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race 42 brent mustangburger french rally car raoul çaroule is counting on a big boost headed through there darrell cartrip and don't forget lightning mcqueen his mentor the hudson hornet was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time in my opinion mcqueen is the best all-around racer in this competition really darrell i think you need to clean your windshield you're clearly not seeing this for what it is: francesco's race to lose brent mustangburger it's time to find out the racers are locking into the grid --- speed i am speed really you are "speed" then francesco is triple speed francesco is triple speed francesco likes this mcqueen it's really getting him into the zone he is so getting beat today 43 his suspension stats look good tire pressure is excellent he's got plenty of fuel and he's awesome why is he in the pits he's so exposed it's his cover one of the best i've seen too look at the detail on that rust it must have cost him a fortune but why hasn't he contacted us yet there's probably heat on him be patient right of course he'll signal us when he can and then we find out who's behind all this 44 mcqueen it's time to make your move get on the outside and show 'em what doc done taught you mcqueen ten four mater david hobbscap francesco is brought to a screeching halt brent mustangburger lightning mcqueen is the first to take advantage and just like that folks francesco's lead is left in the dust nice call mater keep it up darrell cartrip who-hoo man mcqueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby brent mustangburger everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again brent mustangburger francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt he's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race 45 professor zundapp it is time roger that darrell cartrip oh miguel camino has blown an engine brent mustangburger very unusual darrell he's been so consistent all year you gotta be kidding me what is it it's that tow truck from the bathroom the one from the bathroom yeah the one the american agent passed the device to what about him what about him he's in the pits 46 not for long hold on i think i've got something what is it the pacer from the party last night cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks yep his vin numbers match anyone with him he won't be alone conducting analysis on the target he's not the only one here three five they're everywhere and they're all closing in on oh no finn finn where are you finn get him out of the pits now 47 wow some of them fellers is really loud holley can you hear me over uh what holley get out of the pit now do you hear me mater hey i know you you're that girl from the party last night you wanna do our date right now guys a little too much chatter let's keep this line clear holley there's no time for messing about you've got to get out of the pits is there gonna be cable where you is so i can watch the rest of the race holley you're running out of time finn they're coming shiftwell holley yes i know 48 finn get him out of there i'm trying get out now well all right but i usually like to have a proper detailing done before i meet a lady friend finn mcmissile but you're dead then this shouldn't hurt at all miss shiftwell i've got him in the back alleys east of the garages multiple assailants are closing in quickly finn keep him moving i'm on my way 49 hey new lady friend you like flowers what holley no don't go 'in' anywhere just keep moving stay outside gotcha outside grazie and arrivaderci darrell cartrip i cannot believe what i just saw brent that was a bonehead move you don't open up the inside like that this time i'm gonna make sure you stay dead 50 holley you're doing brilliantly now just stay focused what's that you want me to head toward that ruckus holley no don't go down that street wow a live karate demonstration stop it mater just sign off brent mustangburger they're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line brent mustangburger francesco's the winner mcqueen's number two that was cool hey can i get your autograph 51 hey where'd he go holley our rendezvous has been jeopardized keep the device safe we'll be in touch dadgum did i miss our date francesco over here hey what was your strategy today strategia francesco needs no strategy it's very simple you start the race wait for lightning mcqueen to choke pass him then win francesco always wins it's boring i gotta tell you dude you were in trouble for awhile that dirt track section had you crawling to truly crush one's dream you must first raise their hopes very high 52 53 maybe if i i don't know talked to somebody and explained what happened i could help i don't need your help i don't want your help press hey there he is - mcqueen you had it in the bag - yeah what happened i made a mistake but i can assure you it won't happen again look guys we know what the problem is and we've taken care of it lightning mcqueen loses in the last lap to francesco bernoulli in the first race of the world grand prix and three count em three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel allinol might be to blame allinol is safe alternative fuel is safe there is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out 54 well the jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents but one thing's for sure: lightning mcqueen blew this race team mcqueen can't be happy right now come with me please sir but i'm gonna miss my plane right this way 55 doggone it this is about my hook isn't it i know i should've checked it but i can't really look -- it's attached to me hey i know you you're that feller from the karate demonstration i never properly introduced myself finn mcmissile british intelligence tow mater average intelligence who are you with fbi cia let's just say i'm triple-a affiliated you know i know some karate i don't wanna brag or nothing but i've got me a black fan belt hey you wanna see some moves i made up you're being followed this first one i can reach into a car's hood pull out his battery and show it to him before he stalls i call it "what i accidentally did to my friend luigi once " 56 there he is look i probably ought to go i'm about to miss my flight don't worry i've taken care of that hang on this is first class service you

girlfriend come on get in here 58 boy i tell you what you really do want this first date don't ya that's a no-quit attitude right there hold on sid finn it's now or never hold on mater by the time you

- that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world your best friend mater " i didn't really want him to leave wait there's more here "p s please tell the hotel i didn't mean to order that movie i thought it was just a preview and i didn't realize i was paying for it p p s that's funny right there -- pp " there's a few more pages of p s 's here well at least i know if he's at home he'll be safe now that's how i like to start the day you never feel more alive than when you're almost dead i hope that device didn't fall off that's the closest i ever been to missing my flight that was --- 60 yow still in one piece great i gotta go to a doctor i keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage downloading the photo now hey lemme introduce you two this here is finn mcsomething-or- other he's a first class vip airport whatchamacallit and finn this here's my date i never did get your name oh yes sorry it's shiftwell holley shiftwell it's shiftwell holley --- finally time to see who's behind all this what is this 61 well that's one of the worst engines ever made it's an old aluminum v8 with a lucas electrical system and whitworth bolts shoot them whitworth bolts is a pain tell you what them ain't metric they ain't inches yes ok right but who's engine is this mater well it's kinda hard to tell from this picture ain't it but you're the one who took it holley oh right yes of course "a good agent gets what he can then gets out before he's killed " sorry agent you mean like insurance agent like `like a good neighbor mater is there' wait you mean secret agents you guys is spies holley in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear it was standard in seven models over a 12-year period at least 35 000 cars were made with this engine you're pretty 62 yes alright thank you and so nice just pay attention this seems like a dead end if there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit i'd be a lot happier you might not be happy but i bet this feller is see how he's had most of his parts replaced and see all them boxes over there them's all original parts they ain't easy to come by rare parts that's something we can track exactly well done mater i would never have seen that i know of a black-market parts dealer in paris a treacherous lowlife but he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is mater what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one wait what 63 you obviously have plenty of experience in the field well yeah i live right next to one i don't know finn i ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently you're helping me please mater well okay but you know i'm just a tow truck right right and i'm just in the import export business siddeley yes finn paris tout de suite yeah two of them sweets for me too sid you know i always wanted to be a spy really me too afterburners sir is there any other way 64 once we're inside stay close don't bother checking vin numbers for criminal records they're all dodgy here no vin scans got it don't talk to anyone don't look at anyone and absolutely positively no idling are we clear yes right no idling yes sir mater yeah finn we're not here to go shopping shopping what do you mean why would i --- dadgum - parts for sale monsieur - monsieur parts for sale 65 you gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here look at them hoods i could use a hood sorry fellers i gotta go excuse me what are you selling there you are man there are some great --- mater get back hey wait for me 66 have you lost your mind but i thought --- mater this chap needs a tow hook him up sure thing you rusty piece of junk get your dirty hook off me allez maintenant - vite electroshock are you kidding me easy tomber this is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant informant 67 a rookie eh i never liked new car- smell tomber was doing 20 to life in a moroccan impound the first time i saved him if i recall correctly speaking of recalls you're getting up there in mileage aren't you finn alright we get it you both know each other you're both old so there you go informant inform us that is the worst motor ever made wait that oil filter those wheel bearings do those parts look familiar tomber they should i sold them to whom no idea he's my best customer but he always does his business over the phone i was always wondering why he needs so many parts now i know 68 well a lemon needs parts ain't nothing truer than that "lemon " yeah you know cars that don't ever work right lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter like them gremlins and pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport holley pull up the pictures from the oil platform i want to know what other type of cars were out there right let's see there were hugos and trunkovs mater are these cars considered lemons is the popemobile catholic finn everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars and they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine this explains it what tomber 69 gremlin pacer hugo and trunkovs never get together but they're having a secret meeting in two days where's this meeting taking place porto corsa italy that's where the next race is then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too your chances are more than good i just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday to porto corsa holley contact stephenson and have him meet us at gare de lyon good work mater boy i'll tell you what that three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting you never see this many lemons in one town unless there's a swap meet or something 70 hey how'd you get all them pictures well i remotely reprogrammed porto corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans wow not only is you the prettiest car i ever met but you the smartest too thank you i think that's a familiar sight a hugo being towed but he looks absolutely perfect of course they must be the heads of the lemon families makes sense if i was rich and broke down every day i'd hire me to tow me around all the time too we've got to infiltrate that meeting it's the only way to find out who's behind all this hang on a minute what hold still ahh 71 good job miss shiftwell thank you finn boy i sure wish my friends could see me now guido your eyes do not deceive you we are in italy we are home hey luigi which way to the hotel man what no friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village you will stay with my --- uncle topolino how do they do it these are the same ingredients as back home but it tastes so good 72 it's organic man tree hugger uncle topolino race car you look so down so low is like you have flat tires she said you look like you're starving that she's going to make you a big meal and fatten you up no mama topolino please you don't need to make a fuss capisco i understand is a problem yes between you and a friend how'd you know that a wise car hears one word and understands two that and luigi told me while mama cooks come and take a stroll with me 73 i brought my friend mater along on the trip and i told him he needed to act different that we weren't in radiator springs this mater

that disguised voice "dee-sguised voice " what are you talking about you're nuts you are this is going nowhere fast we really should go grandmother one moment i'd like to see where this is going mater he created allinol yeah but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else what if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad "what if "

i was a kid it was just me and sven until they took me in they did yeah i don't want to scare you they can be a little bit inappropriate and loud very loud they're also stubborn at times and a little overbearing and heavy really really heavy but they're fine you'll get it they mean well kristoff they sound wonderful okay then meet my family hey guys they're rocks he's crazy i'll distract them while you run hi sven's family it's nice to meet you anna because i love you i insist you run i understand you're love experts why aren't you running okay um i'm gonna go-- kristoff kristoff's home kristoff kristoff's home it's been too long kristoff's home kristoff's home wait kristoff oh lemme look at you oh take off your clothes kristoff i wash them ah no i'm gonna keep my clothes on thank you great to see you all where's grandpa he's napping but look i grew a mushroom and i earned my fire crystal i passed a kidney stone pick me up trolls they're trolls he's brought a girl he's brought a girl what's going on i've learned to just roll with it let me see bright eyes working nose strong teeth yes yes yes she'll do nicely for our kristoff wait oh um no you've got the wrong idea that's not why i brought her here right we're not i'm not-- what's the issue dear why are you holding back from such a man is it the clumpy way he walks or the grumpy way he talks or the pear-shaped square-shaped weirdness of his feet and though we know he washes well he always ends up sorta smelly but you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet so he's a bit of a fixer upper so he's got a few flaws- his peculiar brain dear his thing for the reindeer that outside a few of nature's laws so he's a bit of a fixer upper but this we're certain of- you can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love can we just stop talking about this we've got a real actual problem here i'll say-- is it the way that he runs scared or that he's socially impaired or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods are you holding back your fondness due to his unmanly blondeness or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods he's just a bit of a fixer upper- he's got a couple a' bugs no i don't his isolation is confirmation of his desperation for healing hugs so he's a bit of a fixer upper but we know what to do the way to fix up this fixer upper is to fix him up with you enough she's engaged to someone else okay so she's a bit of a fixer upper that's a minor thing this quote "engagement" is a flex arrangement and by the way i don't see no ring so she's a bit of a fixer upper her brain's a bit betwixt get the fiance out of the way and the whole thing will be fixed we aren't saying you can change him 'cause people don't really change we're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange people make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed but throw a little love their way and you'll bring out their best true love brings out the best everyone's a bit of a fixer upper that's what it's all about father sister brother we need each other to raise us up and round us out everyone's a bit of a fixer upper but when push comes to shove- the only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is true true true true love do you anna take kristoff to be your trollfully wedded-- wait what you're getting married love anna she's as cold as ice there's strange magic here grand pabbie bring her to me kristoff anna your life is in danger there is ice in your heart put there by your sister if not removed to solid ice will you freeze forever what no so remove it grand pabbie i can't if it was her head that would be easy but only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart an act of true love a true love's kiss perhaps anna we've got to get you back to hans hans help us out sven come on olaf i'm coming let's go kiss hans who is this hans we are here to find princess anna be on guard but no harm is to come to the queen do you understand go away the queen no please stay away get her get her queen elsa don't be the monster they fear you are no what have i done why did you bring me here i couldn't just let them kill you but i'm a danger to arendelle get

kiss me what now here we go we'll give you two some privacy what happened out there elsa struck me with her powers you said she'd never hurt you i was wrong anna she froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me a true love's kiss oh anna if only there was someone out there who loved you what you said you did as thirteenth in line in my own kingdom i didn't stand a chance i knew i'd have to marry into the throne somewhere-- what are you talking about as heir elsa was preferable of course but no one was getting anywhere with her but you- hans you were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me just like that i figured after we married i'd have to stage a little accident for elsa hans no stop but then she doomed herself and you were dumb enough to go after her please all that's left now is to kill elsa and bring back summer you're no match for elsa no you're no match for elsa i on the other hand am the hero who is going to save arendelle from destruction you won't get away with this oh i already have please somebody help it's getting colder by the minute if we don't do something soon we'll all freeze to death prince hans princess anna is dead what no mon dieu what happened to her she was killed by queen elsa her own sister at least we got to say our marriage vows before she died in my arms there can be no doubt now queen elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger prince hans arendelle looks to you with a heavy heart i charge queen elsa of arendelle with treason and sentence her to death she's dangerous move quickly and with resolve what is it

are no accidents forgive us master we have failed you no if the panda has not quit by morning then i will have failed you wait wait wait i bring a message from master shifu what "double the guard extra precautions your prison may not be adequate " you doubt my prison's security absolutely not shifu does i'm just the messenger i'll give you a message for your master shifu escape from chogun prison is impossible whoa impressive isn't it yes very impressive it's very impressive one way in one way out one thousand guards and one prisoner yes except that prisoner is tai lung take us down what are you doing oh my behold tai lung i'll um i'm just gonna wait right here it's nothing to worry about it's perfectly safe oof crossbows at the ready crossbows hey tough guy did you hear oogway's finally gonna give someone the dragon scroll and it's not gonna be you what are you doing don't get him mad what's he gonna do about it i've got him completely immobilized awww did i step on the witty kitty's tail awww i'm good i've seen enough i'm gonna tell shifu he's got nothing to worry about no he doesn't okay i'll tell him that can we please go now dragon warrior dragon warrior wait a second hello uh i think there's been a slight mistake everyone seems to think that i'm uh whoa the sacred hall of warriors no way would you look at this place master flying rhino's armor with authentic battle damage the sword of heroes said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- ow the invisible trident of destiny i've only seen paintings of that painting nooo ohhhh the legendary urn of whispering warriors said to contain the souls of the entire tenshu army hellooo have you finished sight-seeing sorry i should've come to see you first my patience is wearing thin oh well i mean it's not like you were going anywhere would you turn around sure hey how's it going now how do you get five thousand-- master shifu someone broke that but i'm gonna fix it do you have some glue ow ooh splinter so you're the legendary dragon warrior hmmm uh i guess so wrong you are not the dragon warrior you will never be the dragon warrior until you have learned the secret of the dragon scroll whoa so how does this work you have a ladder or trampoline or you think it's that easy that i am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power no i one must first master the highest level of kung fu and that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you someone like me yes look at you this fat butt flabby arms those are sensitive in the flabby parts and this ridiculous belly hey --and utter disregard for personal hygiene now wait a minute that's a little uncalled-for don't stand that close i can smell your breath listen oogway said that i was the- the wuxi finger hold not the wuxi finger hold oh you know this hold developedbymasterwuxiinthethirddyna sty-- yes oh then you must know what happens when i flex my pinky no no no you know the hardest part of this the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards okay okay take it easy now listen closely panda oogway may have picked you but when i'm through with you i promise you you're going to wish he hadn't are we clear yeah we're clear we're clear we are so clear good i can't wait to get started let's begin wait wait wait what now yes now unless you think the great oogway was wrong and you are not the dragon warrior oh okay well-- i don't know if i can do all of those moves well if we don't try we'll never know will we uh yeah it's just maybe we can find something more suited to my level and what level is that well ya know i'm not a master but uh let's just start at zero level zero there is no such thing as level zero hey maybe i can start with that that we use that for training children and for propping the door open when it's hot but if you insist whoa the furious five you're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you mantis you're about the same go ahead panda show us what you can do um are they gonna watch or should i just wait until they get back to work or something hit it ok i mean i just ate so i'm still digesting so my kung fu might not be as good as later on just hit it alright whatcha got you got nothing cause i got it right here you picking on my friends get ready to feel the thunder i'm comin' at him with the crazy feet whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet i'm a blur i'm a blur you never seen bear style you only seen praying mantis or i could come at you monkey style or i'm comin' at ya snikity-snake would you hit it alright alright why don't you try again a little harder how's tha-- ow that hurts this'll be easier than i thought feeling a little nauseous ow those are hard ooh i think i oooohoohoo my tenders how did i do there is now a level zero there's no words no denying that i don't understand what master oogway was thinking the poor guy's just gonna get himself killed he is so mighty the dragon warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire when he walks the very ground shakes one would think that master oogway would choose someone who actually knew kung fu yeah or could at least touch his toes or even see his toes okay great oh hey hi you're up am now i was just uh some day huh that kung fu stuff is hard work right your biceps sore um i've had a long and rather disappointing day so uh yeah i should probably get to sleep now yeah yeah yeah of course okay thanks it's just i'm such a big fan oop you guys were totally amazing at the battle of weeping river outnumbered a thousand to one but you didn't stop and then you just hi-yah ooo sorry about that look you don't belong here i know i know you're right i just - my whole life i've dreamed of- no no no i meant you don't belong here i mean in this room this is my room property of crane oh okay right right yeah you want to get to sleep yeah i'm keepin' you up we got big things tomorrow alright you're awesome last thing i'm gonna say okay bye bye what was that i didn't say anything okay alright goodnight sleep well seemed a little bit awkward master tigress didn't mean to wake you just uh you don't belong here uh yeah yeah of course this is your room i mean you don't belong in the jade palace you're a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do you will be gone by morning big fan i see you have found the sacred peach tree of heavenly wisdom is that what this is i am so sorry i thought it was just a regular peach tree i understand you eat when you are upset upset i'm not upset what makes you think i'm upset so why are you upset i probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu in the history of china in the history of sucking probably and the five man you should have seen them they totally hate me totally how's shifu ever going to turn me into the dragon warrior i mean i'm not like the five i've got no claws no wings no venom even mantis has those thingies maybe i should just quit and go back to making noodles quit don't quit noodles don't noodles you are too concerned with what was and what will be there is a saying: yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift that is why it is called the present what's happening fire crossbows tai lung is free i must warn shifu you're not going anywhere and neither is he let go of me bring it up wait bring it back he's coming this way he won't get far archers we're dead so very very dead heh heh not yet we're not now can we run now yes nuuu urggg urrk i'm glad shifu sent you i was beginning to think i had been forgotten fly back there and tell them the real dragon warrior is coming home good morning master panda panda wake up hmm he's quit what do we do now master with the panda gone who will be the dragon warrior all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time the true dragon warrior will be revealed what are you doing here hey huh good morning master i thought i'd warm up a little you're stuck stuck whaa pfft stuck yeah i'm stuck help him oh dear maybe on three one two- threeeee thank you don't mention it no really i appreci-- --ever you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night it takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat put that down the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones yeah excellent let's get started are you ready i was born ready-- eaghhh i'm sorry brother i thought you said you were ready that was awesome let's go again i've been taking it easy on you panda but no more your next opponent will be me alright let's go step forth the true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it oh yeah to take his strength and use it against him --until he finally falls or quits but a real warrior never quits don't worry master i will never quit if he's smart he won't come back up those steps but he will he's not gonna quit is he he's not gonna quit bouncin' i'll tell ya that aaaoo whoohoo eeeee hee- hee i thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better trust me it will it's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this-- fat fur i was gonna say fur sure you were who am i to judge a warrior based on his size i mean -- look at me i'm over here ow maybe you should take a look at this again oh okay ow don't stop it stop-- yow i know master shifu's trying to inspire me and all but if i didn't know any better i'd say he was trying to get rid of me i know he can seem kind of heartless-- but ya know he wasn't always like that according to legend there was once a time when master shifu actually used to smile no yes but that was before before what before tai lung uh yeah we're not really supposed to talk about him well if he's going to stay here he should know guys guys i know about tai lung he was a student the first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu and then he turned bad and now he's in jail he wasn't just a student shifu found him as a cub and he raised him as a son and when the boy showed talent in kung fu shifu trained him he believed in him he told him he was destined for greatness it was never enough for tai lung he wanted the dragon scroll but oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused outraged tai lung laid waste to the valley he tried to take the scroll by force and shifu had to destroy what he had created but how could he shifu loved tai lung like he'd never loved anyone before or since and now he has a chance to make things right to train the true dragon warrior and he's stuck with you: a big fat panda who treats it like a joke doieeeee oh that is it wait my fault i accidentally tweaked his facial nerve and may have also stopped his heart inner peace inner peace inner peace would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down inner oh zeng excellent i could use some good news right now uh master master hmmm i have-- it's-- it's very bad news ah shifu there is just news there is no good or bad master your vision your vision was right tai lung has broken out of prison he's on his way that is bad news if you do not believe that the dragon warrior can stop him the panda master that panda is not the dragon warrior he wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident there are no accidents yes i know you've said that already twice well that was no accident either thrice my old friend the panda will never fulfill his destiny nor you yours until you let go of the illusion of control illusion yeah look at this tree shifu i cannot make it blossom when it suits me nor make it bear fruit before its time but there are things we can control i can control when the fruit will fall and i can control-- --where to plant the seed that is no illusion master ah yes but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree you may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach but a peach cannot defeat tai lung maybe it can if you are willing to guide it to nurture it to believe in it but how how i need your help master no you just need to believe promise me shifu promise me you will believe i i will try good my time has come you must continue your journey without me what what are you master you can't leave me you must believe master so i'm like fine you may be a wolf you may be the scariest bandit in haijin province but you're a lousy tipper really so how'd you get out of there alive i mean i didn't actually say that but i thought it in my mind if he could read my mind he'd have been like "what " order up hope you like it this is really good no c'mon you should try my dad's secret ingredient soup he actually knows the secret ingredient what are you talking about this is amazing wow you're a really good cook i wish my mouth was bigger tigress you gotta try this it is said that the dragon warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe i guess my body doesn't know it's the dragon warrior yet i'm gonna need a lot more than dew and uh universe juice what oh nothing master shifu you will never be the dragon warrior unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth what is that noise you're making laughter i never heard of it work hard panda and maybe someday you will have ears like mine ears it's not working for you i thought they were pretty good it's shifu of course it's shifu what do you think i'm doing ooh master shifu you think this is funny tai lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children what he is coming for the dragon scroll and you are the only one who can stop him and here i am saying you got no sense of humor i'm gonna stop tai what you're serious and i have to-- uh master oogway will stop him he did it before he'll do it again oogway cannot not anymore our only hope is the dragon warrior the panda yes the panda master please let us stop tai lung this is what you've trained us for no it is not your destiny to defeat tai lung it is his where'd he go you cannot leave a real warrior never quits watch me come on how am i supposed to beat tai lung i can't even beat you to the stairs you will beat him because you are the dragon warrior ow you don't believe that you never believed that from the first moment i got here you've been trying to get rid of me yes i was but now i ask you to trust in your master as i have come to trust in mine you're not my master and i'm not the dragon warrior then why didn't you quit you knew i was trying to get rid of you and yet you stayed yeah i stayed i stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said i smelled it hurt but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me i stayed because i thought if anyone could change me could make me not me it was you the greatest kung fu teacher in all of china but i can change you i can turn you into the dragon warrior and i will c'mon tai lung is on his way here right now and even if it takes him a hundred years to get here how are you gonna change this into the dragon warrior how how how i don't know i don't know that's what i thought this is what you trained me for tigress don't try and stop me we're not trying to stop you what we're coming with you what i eat when i'm upset okay oh no need to explain i just thought you might be monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf don't tell monkey look at you yeah i know i disgust you no no i mean how did you get up there i don't know i guess i-- i don't know i was getting a cookie and yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split no this this is just an accident there are no accidents come with me i know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y but could you at least tell me where we're going you dragged me all the way out here for a bath panda we do not wash our pits in the pool of sacred tears the pool of this is where oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus this is the birthplace of kung fu do you want to learn kung fu yeah then i am your master okay don't cry okay when you focus on kung fu when you concentrate you stink but perhaps that is my fault i cannot train you the way i have trained the five i now see that the way to get through to you is with this oh great `cause i'm hungry good when you have been trained you may eat let us begin after you panda just like that no situps no ten mile hike i vowed to train you and you have been trained you are free to eat enjoy hey i said you are free to eat have a dumpling hey you are free to eat am i are you i'm not hungry master cut it where's the dragon warrior how do you know you're not looking at her you think i'm a fool i know you're not the dragon warrior none of you i heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen po so that is his name -- po finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary we've got this help her monkey go ack what was i thinking mantis now shifu taught you well but he didn't teach you everything you have done well panda done well done well i've done awesome the mark of a true hero is humility but yes you have done awesome huh guys guys they're dead no they're breathing they're asleep no their eyes are open we were no match for his nerve attack he has gotten stronger who tai lung stronger he's too fast sorry po i thought we could stop him he could have killed you why didn't he so you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts but it won't work uh it might i mean a little i'm pretty scared you can defeat him panda are you kidding if they can't-- they're five masters i'm just one me but you will have the one thing that no one else does you really believe i'm ready you are po behold the dragon scroll it is yours wait what happens when i read it no one knows but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat whoa really that's cool yes and see light in the deepest cave you will feel the universe in motion around you wow can i punch through walls can i do a quadruple back flip will i have invisibility-- focus focus huh oh yeah yeah read it po and fulfill your destiny read it and become the dragon warrior whooaa it's impossible to open come on baby come on now thank you i probably loosened it up for you though okay here goes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's blank what here look no i am forbidden to look upon-- blank i don't i don't understand okay so like oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all no oogway was wiser than us all oh come on face it he picked me by accident of course i'm not the dragon warrior who am i kidding but who will stop tai lung he'll destroy everything and everyone no evacuate the valley you must protect the villagers from tai lung's rage what about you master i will fight him what i can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape but shifu he'll kill you then i will finally have paid for my mistake listen to me all of you it is time for you to continue your journey without me i am very proud to have been your master we've got to get them out safely come little one let's find your mama viper gather the southern farmers mantis the north crane light the way look it's the dragon warrior hey dad po good to have you back son good to be back let's go po so for our next shop it's time to face it -- the future of

it's special there is no secret ingredient i have come home master this is no longer your home and i am no longer your master yes you have a new favorite so where is this po did i scare him off this battle is between you and me so that is how it's going to be that is how it must be i rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness obeying your master is not weakness you knew i was the dragon warrior you always knew but when oogway said otherwise what did you do what did you do nothing you were not meant to be the dragon warrior that was not my fault not your fault who filled my head with dreams who drove me to train until my bones cracked who denied me my destiny it was never my decision to make it is now give me the scroll i would rather die all i ever did i did to make you proud tell me how proud you are shifu tell me tell me i have always been proud of you from the first moment i've been proud of you and it was my pride that blinded me i loved you too much to see what

fear treachery bloodlust thousands of years ago these were the forces that ruled our world a world where prey were scared of predators and predators had an uncontrollable biological urge to maim and maul and blood blood blood and death back then the world was divided in two vicious predator or meek prey but over time we evolved and moved beyond our primitive savage ways now predator and prey live in harmony and every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities yeah i don't have to cower in a herd anymore instead i can be an astronaut i don't have to be a lonely hunter any more today i can hunt for tax exemptions i'm gonna be an actuary and i can make the world a better place i am going to be a police officer bunny cop that is the most stupidest thing i ever heard it may seem impossible

he was attacked no he attacked otterton otterton he went crazy ripped up the car scared my driver half to death and disappeared into the night he's a sweet little otter my child we may be evolved but deep down we are still animals you want to find otterton talk to the driver of the car his name's manchas lives in the rainforest district only he can tell you more mr manchas judy hopps zpd we just want to know what happened to emmitt otterton you should be asking what happened to me whoa a teensy otter did that what happened he was an animal down on all fours he was a savage there was no warning he just kept yelling about the "night howlers " over and over "the night howlers " oh so you know about the night howlers too good good good because the night howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about right yep so uh you just open the door and tell us what you know and we will tell you what we know okay okay clever fox mr manchas buddy are you okay run run what is wrong with him i don't know jump head down officer hopps to dispatch are you familiar with gazelle greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay hold on keep watching who's that beside her who is it wow you are one hot dancer benjamin clawhauser it's me did you think it was real it looks so real it's not it's just a new app hold on a second-- clawhauser listen to me we have a 10-91 jaguar gone savage vine and tu-junja it's tujunga okay we're sending back up hopps hopps there head to the skytrams get in carrots carrots go no no no buddy one predator to another--___* now i can tell you're a little tense so i'm just gonna give you a little personal space-- rabbit whatever you do do not let go i'm gonna let go no you what no i said-- listen-- noooo one two-- carrots you saved my life well that's what we do at the zp deeeeeeeeeeeee well this should be good i thought this was just a missing mammal case but it's way bigger mr otterton did not just disappear i believe he and this jaguar they went savage sir savage this isn't the stone age hopps animals don't go savage i thought so too `til i saw this: what he was right here the "savage" jaguar sir i know what i saw-- he almost killed us or maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits let's go wait-- sir i'm not the only one who saw him nick you think i'm going to believe a fox well he was a key witness and i enlisted-- two days to find the otter or you quit that was the deal badge but sir we badge uh no what did you say fox sorry what i said was "no " she will not be giving you that badge look you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks yeah no wonder she needed to get help from a fox none of you guys were gonna help her were you here's the thing chief you gave her the 48 hours so technically we still have 10 left to find our mr otterton and that's exactly what we're gonna do so if you'll excuse us we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack good day officer hopps thank you never let `em see that they get to you so things do get to you no i mean not anymore but i was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once har-har no it's true i think was 8 or maybe 9 and all i wanted to do was join the junior ranger scouts so my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform because by god i was gonna fit in even if i was the only predator in the troop-- the only fox okay nick i was gonna be part of a pack ready for initiation yeah pretty much born ready i was so proud okay now raise your right hand and deliver the oath i nicholas wilde promise to be brave loyal helpful and trustworthy even though you're a fox what no what did i do wrong you guys no please tell me what did i do wrong what did i do if you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle you're even dumber than you look aw is he gonna cry i learned two things that day one i was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me and two if the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy there's no point in trying to be anything else nick you are so much more than that boy look at that traffic down there how about we go out to chuck in traffic central-- chuck how are things looking on the jam cams nick i'm glad you told me the jam cams seriously it's okay no-n-shh-shush there are traffic cameras everywhere all over the canopy whatever happened to that jaguar-- the traffic cams would have caught it bingo pretty sneaky slick however if you didn't have access to the system before i doubt chief buffalo butt is gonna let you into it now no but i have a friend at city hall who might sir if we could just review these very important-- sir ooo i'm so sorry sir okay i heard you bellwether just take care of it please and clear my afternoon i'm going out no no but sir you do have a meeting with herds and grazing sir if i could just-- oh mutton chops assistant mayor bellwether we need your help we just need to get into the traffic cam database so fluffy hey sheep never let me this close you can't just touch a sheep's wool it's like cotton candy stop it where to rainforest district vine and tujunga there traffic cams for the whole city this is so exciting actually well you know i never get to do anything this important but you're the assistant mayor of zootopia oh i'm more of a glorified secretary i think mayor lionheart just wanted the sheep vote but he did give me that nice mug feels good to be appreciated smellwether that's a fun little name he likes to use i called him lionfart once he did not care for that let me tell you it was not a good day for me yes sir i thought you were going to cancel my afternoon oh dear i better go -- let me know what you find it was really nice for me to be-- while we're young smellwether you think when she goes to sleep she counts herself shush okay traffic cams tujunga tujunga we're in who are these guys timberwolves look at these dumdums betcha a nickel one of em's gonna howl and there it is what is it with wolves and the howling it's like-- howlers night howlers that's what manchas was afraid of wolves the wolves are the night howlers if they took manchas i bet they took otterton too all we gotta do is find out where they went wait where'd they go you know if i wanted to avoid surveillance because i was doing something illegal-- which i never have-- i would use the maintenance tunnel 6b which would put them out right there well look at you junior detective you know i think you'd actually make a pretty good cop how dare you acacia alley ficus underpass south canyon they're heading out of town where does that road go gary quit it you're gonna start a howl i didn't start it oooooooo oooooooooo come on you are a clever bunny it looks like this was a hospital you know after you you're the cop okay all clear all this equipment is brand new carrots claw marks yeah huge huge claw marks i mean what kind of-- mr manchas it's him we found our otter mr otterton my name is officer judy hopps your wife sent me to find you we're gonna get you out of here now or not guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus 11 12 13 14 not including manchas it's 14 chief bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files they're all here all the missing mammals are right here enough i don't want excuses doctor i want answers mayor lionheart please we're doing everything we can really cuz i got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy-- and you can't tell me why now i'd call that awfully far from doing everything sir it may be time to consider their biology what what do you mean biology the only animals going savage are predators we cannot keep it a secret we need to come forward hmm great idea tell the public and how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion i'll be ruined well what does chief bogo say chief bogo doesn't know and we are going to keep it that way someone's here sir you need to go now security sweep the area great we're dead we're dead that's it i'm dead you're dead everybody's dead can you swim what can i swim yes i can swim why carrots hopps judy we gotta tell bogo wow you are one hot dancer chief bogo chief bogo not now wait is that gazelle no i am gazelle and you are one hot dancer you have the app too oh jeeeeez clawhauser can't you see i'm working on the missing mammal cases oh yes of course about that sir officer hopps just called she found all of `em wow i'm impressed mayor lionheart you have the right to remain silent anything-- you don't understand i was trying to protect the city you were just trying to protect your job no listen we still don't know why this is happening it could destroy zootopia you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law ladies and gentlemammals 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit who will speak to you in a moment but first let me remind you-- rrrgh i am so nervous okay press conference 101: you wanna look smart answer their question with your own question and then answer that question like this "excuse me officer hopps what can you tell us about the case " "well was this a tough case yes yes it was " you see you should be there with me we did this together well am i a cop no no i am not funny you should say that because i've been thinking it would be nice to have a partner here in case you need something to write with at twenty-two hundred hours we found all these missing animals officer hopps it's time so now i'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case officer judy hopps officer hopps over here here yes what can you tell us about the animals that went savage well the animals in question are they all different species yes yes they are okay so what is the connection well all we know is that they are all members of the predator family so predators are the only ones going savage that is accu-- yes that is accurate yes wow why is that happening we still don't know-- ah it may have something to do with biology what do you mean by that a biological component you know something in their dna in their dna can you elaborate on that please yes what i mean is thousands of years ago um predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts for whatever reason they seem to be reverting back to their primitive savage ways of course they did aw is he gonna cry officer hopps could it happen again it is possible so we must be vigilant and we at the zpd are prepared and are here to protect you will more mammals go savage what is being done to protect us have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators okay thank you officer hopps uh that's all the time that we have no more questions was i okay oh you did fine that went so fast i didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we-- oh i think you said plenty what do you mean clearly there's a biological component these predators may be reverting back to their primitive savage ways are you serious i just stated the facts of the case i mean it's not like a bunny could go savage right but a fox could huh nick stop it you're not like them oh there's a them now you know what i mean you're not that kind of predator the kind that needs to be muzzled the kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent yeah don't think i didn't notice that little item the first time we met so let me ask you a question are you afraid of me do you think i might go nuts do you think i might go savage do you think i might try to eat you i knew it just when i thought somebody actually believed in me probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner no nick nick officer hopps were you just threatened by that predator no he's my friend we can't even trust our own friends that is not what i said please are we safe have any other foxes gone savage more bad news in this city gripped by fear a caribou is in critical condition the victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear this-- the 27th such attack-- comes just one week after zpd officer judy hopps

once upon a time in a faraway land a young prince lived in a shining castle although he had everything his heart desired the prince was spoiled selfish and unkind but then one winter's night an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within and when he dismissed her again the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress the prince tried to apologize but it was too late for she had seen that there was no love in his heart and as punishment she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there ashamed of his monstrous form the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his twenty-first year if he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would be broken if not he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time as the years passed he fell into despair and lost all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast little town it's a quiet village every day like the one before little town full of little people waking up to say bonjour bonjour bonjour bonjour bonjour there goes the baker with his tray like always the same old bread and rolls to sell every morning just the same

myself i'd like to look around if that's all right oh would you like a tour wait a second wait a second i'm not sure that's such a good idea we can't let her go poking around in certain places if you know what i mean perhaps you could take me i'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle well actually ah yes i do as you can see the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a minimalist rococo design note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings this is yet another example of the neo-classic baroque period and as i always say if it's not baroque don't fix it ha ha ha now then where was i as you were now if i may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the--mademoiselle what's up there where up there nothing absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing dusty dull very boring oh so that's the west wing nice going i wonder what he's hiding up there hiding the master is hiding nothing then it wouldn't be forbidden perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else we have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to maybe later the gardens or the library perhaps you have a library oh yes indeed with books gads of books mountains of books forests of books cascades of books swamps of books more books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime books on every subject ever studied by every author who ever set pen to paper why did you come here i'm sorry i warned you never to come here i didn't mean any harm do you realize what you could have done please stop no get out get out wh- where are you going promise or no promise i can't stay here another minute oh no wait please wait phillipe runs out on a frozen pond but his and belle's weight collapse the ice the wolves chase her into the water some begin to drown but phillipe is able to get out of the water before anything serious happens he runs into a clearing but becomes surrounded by wolves he bucks throwing belle off and wrapping the reins around a tree branch the wolves begin their attack on phillipe but belle comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick one wolf grabs the stick in its mouth and breaks half of it off leaving belle defenseless another leaps at her grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground she looks up and sees a wolf about to jump on top of her it leaps and is caught in mid-air by beast he throws the wolf away then stands behind them and belle they lunge at each other one rips a hole in beast's shoulder and the others focus their attack on that spot finally beast throws a wolf against a tree knocking it out the others turn and run in fear beast turns back to belle looks at her despairingly then collapses belle grateful to be alive turns back to phillipe and begins to get on but her conscience takes over and she walks over to the fallen beast fade to belle and phillipe walking back to the castle with beast on the horse's back fade to int of den with belle pouring hot water out of mrs potts she soaks a rag in the water then turns to beast who is licking his wounds ) here now oh don't do that just hold still that hurts if you'd hold still it wouldn't hurt as much well if you hadn't run away this wouldn't have happened well if you hadn't frightened me i wouldn't have run away well you shouldn't have been in the west wing well you should learn to control your temper now hold still this may sting a little by the way thank you for saving my life you're welcome d'arque: i don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night but they said you'd make it worth my while aah i'm listening it's like this i've got my heart set on marrying belle but she needs a little persuasion turned him down flat everyone knows her father's a lunatic he was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle d'arque: maurice is harmless the point is belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up yeah even marry him d'arque: so you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she agrees to marry you oh that is despicable i love it if no one will help me then i'll go back alone i don't care what it takes i'll find that castle and somehow i'll get her out of there belle maurice oh well i guess it's not gonna work after all they have to come back sometime and when they do we'll be ready for them lefou don't move from that spot until belle and her father come home but but aww nuts i've never felt this way about anyone i want to do something for her but what well there's the usual things--flowers chocolates promises you don't intend to keep ahh no no it has to be something very special something that sparks her inter--wait a minute belle there's something i want to show you but first you have to close your eyes it's a surprise can i open them no no not yet wait here now can i open them all right now i can't believe it i've never seen so many books in all my life you--you like it it's wonderful then it's yours oh thank you so much oh would you look at that ha ha i knew it would work what what works it's very encouraging isn't this exciting i didn't see anything come along chip there's chores to be done in the kitchen but what are they talking about what's going on belle looks at him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon but he has little success finally belle puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast beast looks at the compromise and does the same they both begin to sip their breakfast out of their bowls fade to courtyard where belle and beast are feeding the birds ) there's something sweet and almost kind but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined but now he's dear and so unsure i wonder why i didn't see it there before she glanced this way i thought i saw and when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw no it can't be i'll just ignore but then she's never looked at me that way before new and a bit alarming who'd have ever thought that this could be true that he's no prince charming but there's something in him that i simply didn't see well who'd have thought well bless my soul and who'd have known well who indeed and who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own it's so peculiar we'll wait and see a few days more there may be something there that wasn't there before yes perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before what there may be something there that wasn't there before what's there

many strange legends are told of these jungles of india but none so strange as the story of a small boy named mowgli it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound [bagheera hears baby crying stops and turns to look] it was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle [bagheera looks into the basket with baby mowgli] it was a man-cub had i known how deeply i was to be involved i would have obeyed my first impulse and walked away [baby mowgli stops crying and starts giggling and cooing bagheera turns back lies down on the branch and looks at him playfully] this man-cub would have to have nourishment and soon it was many days travel to the nearest man-village and without a mother's care he would soon perish then it occurred to me {dissolve to five wolf cubs playing and their mother raksha bagheera is looking at them from bushes} a family of wolves i knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs [bagheera with the basket watches from the bushes as the wolves walk into their lair and puts the basket right before the entrance mogli lies silent and bagheera pushes the basket to make him cry and hides fast wolves come out and look at mowgli] why there'd be no problem with the mother thanks to maternal instinct but i wasn't so sure about rama the father [rama comes from forest looks at the man-cub sees smiling face of raksha looks at cute mowgli again and smiles too the "my own home" theme starts in the background as they carry basket with baby mowgli into the wolf lair ] {dissolve to bagheera on a branch looking at mowgli} ten times the rains have come and gone and i often stopped by to see how mowgli the man-cub was getting along he was a favorite with all young wolf cubs of the pack whoo-whoo-whooo [mowgli's brothers run to him and play] no man-cub was ever happier and yet i knew that someday he would have to go back to his own kind {dissolve to council rock} then one night the wolf pack elders met at council rock because shere khan the tiger had returned to their part of the jungle this meeting was to change the man-cub's entire future shere khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him now are we all in agreement as to what must be done [wolves nod] now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father rama come over here please yes akela the council has reached its decision man-cub can no longer stay with the pack he must leave at once leave i am sorry rama there is no other way but-but the man-cub is-is like my own son surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack but rama even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger but the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle akela perhaps i can be of help you bagheera how i know of a man-village where he'll be safe mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together i'm sure he'll go with me so be it now there's no time to lose good luck {dissolve to mowgli riding on bagheera's back in the night} bagheera i'm getting a little sleepy shouldn't we start back home mowgli this time we're not going back i'm taking you to a man-village but why because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle and he has sworn to kill you kill me but why would he wanna do that he hates men and shere khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man - just another hunter with a gun uhh we'll just explain him that i'd never do a thing like that nonsense no one explains anything to shere khan well maybe so but i'm not afraid and besides i-- now that's enough we'll spend a night here things will look better in the morning man-cub man-cub now come on up this tree it's safer up there uh i don't want to go back to the man-village go on up you go that limb way up there try [mowgli tries to climb the tree-trunk but can't] is that all the better you can climb it's too it's too big around and besides i don't have any claws [bagheera helps and with some grunting gets mowgli on that limb] now get some sleep we've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow uh i wanna stay in the jungle huh heh you wouldn't last one day [he yawns and lies down to sleep] i am not afraid i can look after myself [kaa appears from limbs above] ss-say now what have we here [mowgli sticks his tongue at kaa] it's a man-cub a delis-ci-ous man-cub oh go away and leave me alone bagheera : oh that's just what i should do but i'm not now please go to sleep man-cub yes-ss man-cub please [he starts hypnotizing mowgli] go to sleep please go to sleep sleep little man-cub rest in piece [kaa's tail goes around mowgli in circles] sleep ss-sleep ba-- bah-- bagheera -- [kaa gets to his neck and mowgli gulps] bagheera : oh no look there's no use arguing anymore now no more talk 'till morning he won't be here in the morning huh oh yes he will kaa [bagheera wakes up and sees kaa moving mowgli into his open mouth he hits kaa] hold it kaa ohhh my sinus-ss you have just made a ss-serious mistake my friend a very ss-stupid now now now kaa i was-- mistake [mowgli comes up climes out of kaa's relaxed coils] look me in the eye when i'm speaking to you p-please kaa both eyes if you please [bagheera gets fully hypnotyzed and sits still mowgli meanwhile is pushing kaa's coils off the branch] you have just ss-sealed your doom [weight of the part of his body mowgli pushed down suddenly makes him fall] oooh look bagheera heh-heh look bagheera wake up bagheera [he hits bagheera's cheeks a little] ah duh wha-- kaa : just you wait 'til i get you in my coils [he suddely stops because a knot on his tail gets stuck between some bamboo stems] bagheera he's got a knot in his tail kaa hee-hee-hee he's got a knot in his tail : ooo this is going to slow down my slithering ha-ha-ha so you can look out for yourself can you so you want to stay in the jungle do you yes i want to stay in the jungle d'oh now for the last time go to sleep man-cub huh man-cub ahh [finally they both sleep] {fade to morning they still sleep when grounds starts shaking rythmically} hup two three four keep it up two three four hup two three four keep it up two three four hup two three four [mowgli wakes up] a parade oh no the dawn patrol again [mowgli gets down on the ground to look closer] company sound off oh the aim of our patrol elephant #3: is a question rather droll for to march and drill over field and hill [they trumpet] is a military goal is a military goal with a hup two three four dress it up two three four by the ranks or single file over every jungle mile oh we stamp and crush through the underbrush [hathi jr trumpets] in the militaly style in the military style [mowgli comes to hathi jr ] hello what are you doing shh drilling mowgli : can i do it too sure just do what i do but don't talk in rank it's against regulations [mowgli walks after hathi jr in the rear of the file] to the rear march [they walk to the rear hathi jr and mowgli collide] the other way turn around hup two three four keep it up two three four to the rear ho company halt [mowgli collides with hathi jr again] that means "stop" company left face march march march my feet are killing me elephant #2: i am putting in for a transfer to another herd silence in the ranks [he walks around the rank] dress up that line [elephants raise there rears] pull it in winifred [he walks back to front] inspection arms

my man elephant #2: yes sir very good carry on [hathi looks at elephant #3 who is chewing on some grass] ahem hmm let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets elephant #3: yes sir esprit de corps that's the way i earned my commission in the maharaja's pachyderm brigade back in '88 it was or was it winifred : here it comes the victoria-cross bit again it was then i recieved the victoria cross for bravery above and beyond the call of duty ha-ha those were the days discipline discipline was the thing builds character and all that sort of thing [loud snap of the small bamboo stick hathi leaned on interrupts his speech] oh where was i oh yes inspection [he looks at elephant #4] well very good [then to elephant #5] wipe off that silly grin soldier this is the army [comes to elephant #6 and kills a fly buzzing above his head] ahem eyes front [now elephant #7] tsk-tsk-tsk leutenant that haircut is not regulation rather on the gaudy side don't you think [he cuts his hair

ancient ruins] whew ha ha ha man that's what i call a swingin' party {fade out change of sides on the disk fade into night mowgli asleep baloo and bagheera talking} and furthermore mowgli seems to

confound that ridiculous colonel hathi comany sound off oh we march from here to there elephant #3: and it doesn't matter where [elephants are actually in different order now elephant #3 is walking 5th #2 is #6 and winifred who was #1 is now #7 - all backwards except that hathi is still ahead of the herd and hathi jr behind it] you can hear us push through the deepest bush hup two three four with a military air with a military air [they trumpet] the jungle patrol we're a crackerjack bridage on a pachyderm parade but we'd rather stroll to a water hole hup two three four for a furlough in the shade stop [elephants don't notice] wait a minute halt [elephants stop crashing into each other] who said "halt" i give the commands around here now speak up who was it oh it was me colonel what

preposterous pop the man-cub and i are friends he'll get hurt if we don't find him please pop sir please now don't you worry son you father had a plan in mind all the time huh sure you did troopers company left face volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward [hathi turn around all elephants do one step behind except elephant #3 who then notices it and step behind too] ha ha that's what i like to see devotion to duty you volunteers will find the lost man-cub thank you colonel now there's no time to lose [bagheera leaves] yes well good luck : when the man-cub is sighted you will sound your trumpet 3 times elephant #2: yes sir [he trumpets and hathi silences him] shh not now soldier elephant #2: sorry sir hathi comes to elephant #7: leutenant our strategy shall be the element of surprise you will take one squad and cover the right flank [shere khan leans forward to hear the whisper] elephant #7: yes sir hathi : and i shall take the other squad on the left flank company forward march [elephants walk away falling trees as they go] element of surprise i say ha ha ha and now for my rendezvous with the lost man-cub {fade to mowgli walking aimlessly} [kaa picks mowgli from the ground and raises to the branch he is on] kaa it's you yesss man-cub so nice to see you again sss-sss-sss oh go away leave me alone let me look at you [mowgli turns away from kaa's

blame you i'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours you can believe in me [kaa finally gets to see into mowgli's eyes long enough] trust in me just in me shut your eyes and trust in me hold still please you can sleep safe and sound knowing i am around slip into silent slumber sail on a silver mist slowly and surely your senses will cease to resist [mowgli snores while standing on his head on the tip of kaa's tail] you're snoring sorry trust in me and just in me [shere khan appears below and listens] shut your eyes and trust in me [shere khan pulls kaa by the tail making a doorbell sound] huh ow now what i'll be right down yes yes who is it it's me shere khan i'd like a word with you if you don't mind shere khan what a ss-surprise yes isn't it i just dropped by forgive

the ground] mmm-fff i can't be bothered with that i have no time for that sort of nonsense kaa : some other time perhaps perhaps but at the moment i am searching for a man-cub kaa : man-cub what man-cub the one who is lost now where do you suppose he could be search me that's an excellent idea i'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils would you kaa uh ss-certainly not [puts down the end of his tail] nothing here [shows his open mouth] and nothing in here [mowgli in the coils above snores shere khan glances up and kaa makes snorting sounds] my ss-sinuses hmm indeed and now how about the middle the middle oh the middle [he puts down his middle leaving mowgli in much less coils] ha-ha absolutely nothing in the middle hmmm really well if you do just happen to see the man-cub you will inform me first understand i get the point cross my heart hope to die good show and now i must continue my search for the helpless little lad [shere khan leaves] ooh who does he think he's fooling "helpless little lad" ooh he gives me the shivers [kaa shivers and completely looses grip on now awake mowgli] picking on that poor little helpless boy oh yes poor little helpless boy [mowgli pushes kaa's coils off the branch and he falls down hitting his head on some branches along the way - just like earlier ] oooh you told me a lie kaa you said i could trust you it's like you said you can't trust anyone [he lunges at mowgli but a knot on his tail stops him mowgli leaves] if i never see that skinny little shrimp again it will be too soon ooh my ss-sacroiliac {fade to the vultures

nature's recipies that bring the bare necessities of life
in a far away land long ago lived a king and his fair queen many years had they longed for a child and finally their wish was granted a daughter was born and they called her aurora yes they named her after the dawn for she filled their lives with sunshine then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout the kingdom so that all of high or low estate might pay homage to the infant princess and our story begins on that most joyful day [a crowd is on its way to the castle] joyfully now to our princess we come bringing gifts and all good wishes too we pledge our loyalty anew hail to the princess aurora all of her subjects adore her hail to the king hail to the queen hail to the princess aurora health to the princess wealth to the princess long live the princess aurora hail aurora hail aurora health to the princess wealth to the princess long live the princess aurora hail to the king hail to the queen hail to the princess aurora [inside the castle] thus on this great and joyous day did all the kingdom celebrate the long awaited royal birth and good king stefan and his queen made welcome their life long friend their royal highnesses king hubert and prince phillip fondly had these monarchs dreamed one day their kingdoms to unite thus today would they announce that phillip huberts son and heir to stefan's child would be betrothed and so to her his gift he brought and looked unknowing on his future bride the most honored and exaulted excellencies the three good fairies mistress flora mistress fauna and mistress merryweather [at the cradle] oh the little darling [to the king] your majesties each of us the child may bless with a single gift no more no less [at the cradle] little princess my gift shall be the gift of beauty one gift beauty rare full of sunshine in her hair lips that shame the red red rose she'll walk with springtime wherever she goes tiny princess my gift shall be the gift of song one gift the gift of song melody her whole life long the nightengale's her troubadour bringing her sweet serenade to her door sweet princess my gift shall be [a blow of the wind the door of the castle swings open lightning and thunder maleficent appears] why it's maleficent what does she want here shhh well quite a glittering assemblage king stefan royalty nobility the gentry and how quaint even the rebel [merryweather starts angrily starts to fly towards maleficent but is held back by flora] i really felt quite distressed of not receiving an invitation you weren't wanted not wa oh dear what an awkward situation i had hoped it was merely due to some oversight well in that event i'd best be on my way and you're not offended your excellency why no your majesty and to show i bear no ill will i too shall bestow a gift on the child [the fairies protect the cradle] listen well all of you the princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty beloved by all who know her but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die oh no [takes the child in her arm] ha ha ha ha seize that creature stand back you fools [disappears in a flash of lightning laughing] don't despair your majesties merryweather still has her gift to give then she can undo this fearful curse oh no sire maleficents powers are far too great but she can help but just do your best dear yes sweet princess if through this wicked witches trick a spindle should your finger prick a ray of hope there still may be in this the gift i give at thee not in death but just in sleep the fateful prophecy you'll keep and from this slumber you shall wake when true love's kiss the spell shall break for true love conquers all but king stefan still fearful of his daughter's life did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom should on that very day be burnt so it was done [the fairies alone in the castle drinking tea] silly fiddle faddle now come have a nice cup of tea dear i'm sure it'll work out somehow well a bonfire won't stop maleficent of course not but what will well perhaps if we reason with her reason with maleficent well she can't be all bad oh yes she can i'd like to turn her into a fat ole hoptoad now dear that isn't a very nice thing to say besides we can't you know our magic doesn't work that way it can only do good dear to bring joy and happiness well that would make me happy but there must be some way there he is there he is what is it flora i'm going to shh shh shh even walls have ears [flora sneaks around the corners] follow me [flora mimimizes herself the other two follow her into the insides of a something on the table] i'll turn her into a flower maleficent oh no dear the princess oh she'd make a lovely flower don't you see a flower can't prick its finger it hasn't any that's right she'll be perfectly safe until maleficent sends a frost yes a oh dear she always ruins your nicest flowers you're right and she'll be expecting us to do something like that but what won't she expect she knows everything oh but she doesn't dear maleficent doesn't know anything about love or kindness or the joy of helping earnest you know sometimes i don't think she's really very happy [getting excited] that's it of course it's the only thing she can't understand and won't expect [to herself] oh oh now now we have to plan it carefully let's see woodcutters cottage yes yes the abandoned one of course the king and queen will object but when we explain it's the only way explain what about the three peasant women raising a foundling child deep in the forest oh that's very nice of them who are they turn around [while merryweather and fauna turn around to face a mirror flora changes their outfit to peasantness] iih why it's us you mean we us take care of the baby why not oh i'd like that [notices that her dress is pink and changes its color to blue] well yes yes but will we have to feed it and wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep oh i'd love it you really think we can if humans can do it so can we and we have our magic to help us that's right oh no no no no no magic i'll take those wands right now oh better get rid of those wings too you mean live like mortals for sixteen years [flora removes merryweather's wings] now we don't know how we've never done anything without magic and that's why maleficent will never suspect but who'll wash and cook oh we'll all pitch in i'll take care of the baby let me have it dear [still hunting for merryweather's wand] come along now we must tell their majesties at once [flora changes herself to normal size but first forgets about fauna and merryweather] flora flora [flora notices and blows up fauna and merryweather they leave the room] [outside the castle we see stefan and the queen at a balcony looking down towards the the fairies carrying the baby away] so the king and his queen watched with heavy hearts as their most precious posession their only child disappeared into the night [the storybook] many sad and lonely years passed by for king stefan and his people but as the time for the princesses sixteenth birthday drew near the entire kingdom began to rejoice for everyone knew that as long as maleficent's domain the forbidden mountains thundered with her wrath and frustration her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled [inside maleficent's castle maleficent talks to her search patrol] it's incredible sixteen years and not a trace of her she couldn't have vanished into thin air are you sure you searched everywhere yeah yeah anywhere we all yeah yeah but what about the town the forests the mountains we searched mountains forests and houses and let me see in all the cradles cradle yeah yeah every cradle [angry] cradle [to her pet raven] did you hear that my pet all these years they've been looking for a baby [laughing] oh oh ha ha ha [join laughter] ha ha ha [abruptly stops laughing] [angry] fools idiots imbeciles [drives her search patrol away] [alone with her pet again] oh they're hopeless a disgrace to the forces of evil [talking to the raven] my pet you are my last hope circle far and wide search for a maid of sixteen with hair of sunshine gold and lips red as the rose go and do not fail me [pet flies away] [the camera approaches a house in the woods] and so for sixteen long years the whereabouts of the princess remained a mystery while deep in the forest in a woodcutter's cottage the good fairies carried out their well-laid plan living like mortals they had reared the child as their own and called her briar rose [a window of the cottage opens and briar rose appears humming some tune] on this her sixteenth birthday the good faries had planned a party and something extra special for her surprise [the camera turns downward the fairies sit over a book of dresses] how about this one this is the one i picked oh she'll look beautiful in it now i thought a few changes here aha don't forget a pretty bow and there's the shoulder line we'll make it blue oh no dear pink but of course we'll need a few pleats yes but how are we going to get her out of the house oh i'll think of something [briar rose comes down the stairs and finds the fairies] well and what are you three dears up to up to up to up to eh eh eh we we well we we want you to pick some berries that's it berries berries lots of berries but i picked berries yesterday oh we need more dear lots lots more yes [the fairies push briar rose out of the house] now don't hurry back dear and don't go to far and don't speak to strangers goodbye dear goodbye goodbye goodbye [the fairies close the door and get back inside] i wonder if she suspects of course not come on will she be surprised a real birthday party with a real birthday cake yes and a dress a princess can be proud of i'll get the wands yes you the wands oh no no magic but the sixteen years are almost over we're taking no chances but i never baked a fancy cake oh you won't have to dear i'm going to bake the cake you she's always wanted to dear and this is her last chance well i'm going to make it fifteen layers with pink and blue forgive-me-nots and i'm making the dress but you can't sow and she's never cooked oh it's simple all you do is follow the book [flora directs merryweather to stand on a chair] up here dear you can be the dummy well i still say we ought to use magic [flora throws a sheet of pink cloth above merryweather and begins cutting with a pair of scissors fauna has laid all the ingredients for the cake before her ] [reads from the book] flour three cups [searching] cups cups cups cups cups [finds three cups of different sizes and uses them to pour flour into the bowl] one two three [flora has cut a circular hole into the sheet] what's that for well it's got to have a hole in the bottom that's for the feet to go through it's pink oh lovely shade isn't it but i wanted it blue now dear we decided pink was her color you decided [still reads from the book] two eggs fold in gently fold oh well [fauna puts two eggs into the bowl and starts to fold them in we hear their shells cracking merryweather is completely hulled into the pink cloth] i can't breathe [flora cuts the cloth open at the top merryweather takes a look at the dress from the inside] it looks awful that's because it's on you dear [at her cake] now yeast one tsp tsp one teaspoon one teaspoon of course [flora measures some size of the dress] oh gracious how the child has grown oh it seems only yesterday we brought her here just a tiny baby [merryweather loses a tear] why merryweather whatever's the matter dear after the day she'll be a princess and we won't have any briar rose oh flora we all knew this day had to come but why did it have to come so soon after all we've had her for sixteen years sixteen wonderful years good gracious we're acting like a lot of ninnies come on she'll be back before we get started [briar rose walking through the forest she starts to sing birds answer her singing and wake other animals like chipmunks rabbits and one owl they all come listening] [the camera turns to the background where phillip rides on his horse briar rose's singing is still faintly heard] [to his horse] hear that samson beautiful what is it come on let's find out [turns his horse around but it struggles back] oh come on for an extra bucket of oats and a few carrots [horse nods with his head] hop boy [they ride of towards the singing while samson jumps over a log phillip gets caught in a tree and falls off] ohhh [phillip is heard splashing into the water samson holds and looks at him phillip sprinkles some water at samson] no carrots [the camera turns again to briar rose she's surrounded by the animals of the forest picks berries and sings] i wonder i wonder i wonder why each little bird has a someone to sing to sweet things to a gay little laugh melody i wonder i wonder if my heart keeps singing will my song going in to someone will find me and bring back a love song to me [speaking more to herself than to the birds but they listen and answer her] oh dear why do they still treat me like a child who why flora and fauna and merryweather they never want me to meet anyone [to the animals] but you know something i fooled 'em i have met someone who who who [the animals get more and more excited as she tells the story] oh a prince well he's tall and handsome and and so romantic oh we walked together and talked together and just before we say goodbye he takes me in his arms and then i wake up [the animals sink their heads] yes it's only in my dreams but they say if you dream a thing more than once it's sure to come true and i've seen him so many times [a chipmunk sees the prince's wet clothes hanging in a tree he and the other animals put their heads together make a plan and get over to that tree] you know samson there was something strange about that voice too beautiful to be real maybe it was a mysterious being a wood sprite [samson sees the animals running off with the clothes and neighs] there stop [the owl dresses in phillip's cape and hat and is lifted by birds one rabbit each take the shoes and together they approach briar rose] oh why it's my dream prince [laughs] your highness no i'm really not supposed to speak to strangers but we've met before [dances with her 'dream prince' singing] i know you i walked with you once upon a dream i know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam [phillip and samson approach the scene but hide behind a tree] and i know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem but if i know you i know what you'll do you'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream [while briar rose turns around phillip grabs the animals and places himself instead briar rose still can't see him] but if i know you i know what you'll do you'll love me at once [phillip joins her singing] the way you did [briar rose stops to sing phillip continues] once upon a dream oh [turns around and sees phillip] oh [tries halfheartedly to run off but is held by phillip] i'm awfully sorry i didn't mean to frighten you oh it wasn't that it's just that you're a a a stranger hmm-hmm but don't you remember we've met before we we have of course you said so yourself: once upon a dream [sings] i know you i walked with you once upon a dream i know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam [we see them from remote waltzing at a lake] and i know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem but if i know you i know what you'll do you'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream [they stop dancing phillip lays his arm around briar rose] who are you what's your name hmm oh my name why it's it's oh no no i can't i goodbye [runs off] but when will i see you again oh never never never well maybe someday when tomorrow oh no this evening where at the cottage in the glen [inside the cottage fauna ist lighting the candles on the cake which starts to melt down she tries to hold it with a broom] well what do you think of it [merryweather is still standing as a dolly in a bad joke of a dress] why it's a very unusual cake isn't it yes of course it'll be much stiffer after it's bake of course dear what do you think of the dress well it's not exactly the way it is in the book is it well i improved a bit but perhaps if i added few more ruffolds what do you think i think so what do you think merryweather [struggels out of the dress which falls to pieces] i think we've had enough of this nonsense i think we ought to think of rose and what she'll think of this mess i still think what i thunk before i'm going to get those wands [going off] you know i think she's right here they are good as new careful merryweather quick lock the doors flora you close the windows pluck up every cranny we can't take any chances and now [to flora] you take care of the cake while i clean the room dear and i'll make the dress well hurry [merryweather shortly gets angry but then starts cleaning up] come on bucket mob broom flora says clean up the room [they immediately start to sweep everything clean] and now to make a lovely dress fit the grace of fair princess [works another sheet of pink cloth with her wand] eggs flour milk [the ingredients come walking] just do it the way it's here in the book i'll put on the candles [the cake starts to bake itself] [everything proceeds smoothly and quickly but then merryweather sees the dress] oh no not pink make it blue [she makes it blue] merryweather make it pink [she makes it pink] blue [makes it blue] pink [makes it pink] blue [this time flora stands before the dress and gets blue herself] [they start fighting over the color the camera turns to the fireplace where blazes of color go through the chimney we see the house from the outside and maleficent's pet raven who sees the fireworks inside the house the 'war' continues until they both hit the dress at the same time with the result that it looks like two cans of color were emptied on it] look what you've done shh listen [we hear briar rose humming 'once upon a dream'] it's rose she's back enough of this foolishness [at the dress] make it pink [makes it pink] now hide quick blue [makes it blue] [outside briar rose hurries toward the house] and flora [inside the mob is still sweeping the floor] good gracious who left the mob running stop mob [briar rose opens the door and enters maleficent's raven appears in the door] and flora fauna merryweather where is everybody [sees dress and cake] oh surprise surprise happy birthday oh you darlings this is the

few moments alone [they leave the room] it's that boy she met whatever are we going to do [inside the room the fire goes out and out of a shadow maleficent shortly appears then there's only a ball of light visible aurora gets up in spell and starts towards the light] i don't see why she has to marry any old prince now that's not for us to decide dear [inside the mysterious light moves beyond the fireplace where the wall opens] maybe we should tell king stefan about the boy well why don't we [they hear a faint sound from inside the room] listen maleficent rose rose [they open the door] oh why did we leave her alone rose rose [the fairies see aurora walking through the fireplace but the wall reappears aurora slowly walks up a staircase following the light the fairies try pushing the wall open then flora uses her magic] rose rose where are you rose [there are multiple ways going off the fireplace the fairies don't find the right way at once] rose [briar rose follows the light into a room in the tower where the light turns into a spinnig wheel aurora starts to reach towards it with her left hand] rose don't touch anything [aurora holds back without seeing her we hear maleficent saying] touch the spindle touch it i say [in a flash of light aurora touches the spindle with the middle finger just this moment the fairies appear in the door] oh you poor simple fools thinking you could defeat me me the mistress of all evil well here's your precious princess [maleficent turns beside revealing aurora laying face-down on the floor maleficent disappears laughing] rose oh rose oh i'll never forgive myself we're all to blame [they start crying over aurora's motionless body the camera turns to the window where the last rays of the setting sun shine in deep red] [inside the castle king stefan and the queen sit on their throne hubert approaches stefan] stefan there's something important i have to tell you not now hubert but it's about phillip phillip oh yes of course phillip why where is the boy that's what i'm telling to tell you well send for him immediately but [a fanfare sounds outside] the sun has set make ready to welcome your princess [the crowd before the castle cheers and fireworks are shot into the sky the camera turns towards the tower] [the fairies are crying at a bed they have placed aurora on a red rose in her hand they go onto the balcony and see the cheering crowd] poor king stefan and the queen they'll be heartbroken when they find out they're not going to they aren't we'll put them all to sleep until rose awakens come [they fly around the castle putting everyone to sleep flora has just put the spell on hubert while drifting off to sleep he says ] well just been talking to phillip seems he's fallen in love with some peasant girl peasant girl yes yes the peasant girl who is she where did he meet her just some peasant girl he met where where once upon a dream [finally falls asleep] once upon a dr rose prince phillip [flies to fauna and merryweather] come on we've got to get back to the cottage [the fairies hurriedly start towards back the cottage] [phillip on his horse whistling 'once upon a dream' as he approaches the cottage he knocks on the door] come in [phillip gets in and is surprised by a couple of maleficent's servants he struggles but ultimately is completely tied maleficent and her raven watch the scene with deep satisfaction] [lighting his face with a candle] well this is a pleasant surprise i set my trap for a peasant and lo i catch a prince [laughs] away with him but gently my pets gently i have plans for our royal guest [the fairies are still on their way as they arrive they find the door open they enter and find phillip's hat on the floor] maleficent she's got prince phillip at the forbidden mountatin but we can't we can't go there we can and we must [the fairies reach maleficent's castle and cautiosly approach it they are surprised by some guards but get in unnoticed they find a window to a room where maleficent is having a feast with her 'pets' dancing around a huge fire] [talking to her raven] what a pity prince phillip can't be here to enjoy the celebration come we must go to the dungeon and cheer him up [maleficent walks toward the dungeon her raven and the fairies follow her maleficent talks to phillip who sits chained to the wall head down] oh come now prince phillip why so melancholy a wondrous future lies before you you the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true [the fairies appear in the window of the dungeon maleficent uses her magic stick to depict the following] behold king stefan's castle and in yonder topmost tower dreaming of her true love the princess aurora but see the gracious whim of fate why 'tis the self same peasant maid who won the heart of our noble prince but yesterday she is indeed most wondrous fair gold of sunshine in her hair lips that shame the red red rose in ageless sleep she finds repose the years roll by but a hundred years to a steadfast heart are 'bout a day and now the gates of the dungeon part and the prince is free to go his way off he rides on his noble steed [in maleficent's imagery the prince is shown to be old anything but what she's telling her voice drips with sarcasm] a valiant figure straight and tall to wake his love with love's first kiss and prove that true love conquers all [phillip struggles in his chains merryweather starts towards maleficent in anger] why you mean [merryweather is pulled back by flora the raven has noticed merryweather speaking and turns towards the window but doesn't see the hidden faries] come my pet let us leave our noble prince with these happy thoughts [at the door] a most gratifying day [outside the dungeon she locks the door] for the first time in sixteen years i shall sleep well [the fairies approach phillip] shh no time to explain [using their magic they open phillip's chains and the doorlock] wait prince phillip the road to true love may be barriered by still many more dangers which you alone will have to face so arm thyself with this enchanted shield of virtue and this mighty sword of truth for these weapons of righteousness will triumph over evil [just outside the dungeon the raven waits which flies off screaming the fairies and phillip start upwards the stairs the raven has called maleficent's servants which come streaming downstairs phillip fights some of them but then they jump out a window some rocks are dropped towards phillip] phillip watch out [flora turns the rocks into soap-bubbles a wall of arrows is shot but quickly turned into flying flowers merryweather frees samson phillip rides off on samson towards the gate where hot oil is thrown flora turns it into a rainbow the raven flies towards maleficent's tower trying to wake her he is followed by merryweather who first fails to hit him with her magic at last she turns him into a stone raven just outside maleficent's door maleficent appears in the door] silence [to her raven] you tell those fools to [notices that he is now of stone] no [sees phillip escaping] no [the drawbridge is raised] watch out phillip [samson just makes it over the gap] hurry hurry phillip [maleficent throws two spells but cannot stop them] a forest of thorn shall be his tomb born through the skies on a fog of doom now go with the curse and serve me well round stefan's castle cast by spell [a black clound appears over the castle bolds of lightning strike everywhere causing the growth of thick thorny bushes phillip has to stop before them] [laughs] [phillip

[transforms herself into a huge dragon] [phillip courageously starts towards her but he has no chance against the fire-spying dragon after a short fight he must retreat at a wall he has to stop] [above the prince] hop come this way [phillip climbs up only to see that he is now trapped on a cliff at another blaze of fire he loses his shield] [laughs] [the fairies at the prince they combine their magic on the sword] now sword of truth fly swift and sure that evil die and good endure [phillip throws the sword at the dragon which is hit deadly and collapses] [phillip and the fairies get

throne room everyone awakens too] oh ah forgive me hubert the wine now you were saying i was oh yes well after all stefan this is the fourteenth century yes you said that a moment ago well to come right to the point my son phillip says he's going to marry [hubert is interrupted by a fanfare or to be more precise by the first notes from the 'sleeping beauty waltz' the fairies watch the scene from a balcony as aurora and phillip appear arm in arm walking down the stairs from above ] it's aurora she's here [wipes his eyes mouth open] and phillip [aurora and phillip knee down before the

phillip and they keep on dancing in the clouds all the time the dress keeps changing its color from blue to pink and back] and i know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem but if i know you i know what you'll do [aurora and phillip kiss each other the storybook fades in showing the exact same scene and is slowly closed the storybook says "and they lived happily ever after" below the
