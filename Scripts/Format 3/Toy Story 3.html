<p><strong>Rex</strong>: Bo Peep?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Yeah. Even Bo. All good toys who've gone on to new owners. But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us! He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here. You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm... </p>
<p><strong>Buzz</strong>: And we'll all be together.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Exactly! There's games up there, and books, and... </p>

<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Well, it wasn't easy. What do you mean "escape"?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pricklepants</strong>: Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair. Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Lotso?</p>
<p><strong>Buttercup</strong>: The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: But...  How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pricklepants</strong>: Chuckles. He'll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Chuckles</strong>: Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. I was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. They did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive. Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped.</p>
<p><strong>Lotso</strong>: She replaced us. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>Chuckles</strong>: No, she only replaced you!</p>
<p><strong>Lotso</strong>: She replaced <strong>ALL OF US!!</strong> Didn't she?</p>

<p><strong>Woody</strong>: So how'd you get out?</p>
<p><strong>Chuckles</strong>: I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys, they weren't so lucky. It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys, they don't stand a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: But my friends are in there.</p>
