<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: In the beginning, there was only ocean, until the Mother Island emerged. Te
    Fiti. Her heart held the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared it
    with the world. But in time some began to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed if they could posses it,
    the great power of creation would be theirs. And one day...</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p>[screeching]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: ...the most daring of them all voyaged across the vast ocean to take it. He was
    a demigod of the wind and sea.
</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: He was a warrior. A trickster.</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: A shapeshifter who could change form with the power of his magical fish hook.
</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: And his name was Maui.</p>
<p>[chuckles]</p>
<p>[rumbling]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble giving birth to a terrible
    darkness.
</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p>[rumbling]</p>
<p>[yells]</p>
<p>[screeching]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: Maui tried to escape, but was confronted by another who sought the heart.
</p>
<p>[rumbling]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: Te Ka! A demon of earth and fire.</p>
<p>[rumbling]</p>
<p>[screeching]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: Maui was struck from the sky...</p>
<p>[bang]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: ...never to be seen again. And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti
    were lost to the sea. Where, even now, a thousand years later, Te K&acirc; and the demons of the deep
    still hunt for the heart. Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread, chasing away our fish,
    draining the life from island after island, until every one of us is devoured by the bloodthirsty jaws
    of inescapable death!
</p>
<p>[wailing]</p>
<p>[groaning]</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p>[clapping and chuckling]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: But one day, the heart will be found by someone who will journey beyond the
    reef, find Maui, deliever him across the great ocean to restore Te Fiti's heart and save us all.
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Thank you, Mother. That's enough.</p>
<p><strong>Toddler Moana</strong>: Papa.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: No one goes outside the reef. We are safe here. There is no darkness. There are no
    monsters.
</p>
<p><strong>Toddler</strong>: Monsters!</p>
<p>[all screaming]</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: There's no monsters, no monsters...</p>
<p><strong>Toddler</strong>: It's the darkness!</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tui</strong>: No, there is nothing beyond our reef, but storms and rough seas.
</p>
<p><strong>Toddler</strong>: I'm gonna throw up.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tui</strong>: As long as we stay on our very safe island, we'll be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: The legends are true. Someone will have to go.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Mother, Motunui is a paradise. Who would want to go anywhere else?

<p><strong>Toddler Moana</strong>: What? I wann's go back.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: I know, I know. But you don't go out there. It's dangerous. Moana, come on. Let's
    go back to the village. You are the next great chief of our village of our people.
</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: And you will do wonderous things, my little minnow.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tui</strong>: Oh, yes. But first, you must learn where you're meant to be.

<p>[children laughing]</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Moana. Make way, make way. Moana, it's time you knew, the village of Motinui is
    all you need. The dancers are practicing. They dance to an ancient song. 
</p>
<p><strong>Men</strong>:  Who needs a new song. This old one's all we need. </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  This tradition is our mission. And Moana, there's so much to do. 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  Make way! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Don't trip on the taro root. </p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  That's all you need. </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  We share everything we make! </p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  We make! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  We joke and we weave our baskets. The fishermen come back from the sea. 
</p>
<p><strong>Toddler Moana</strong>:  I wanna see. </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Don't walk away. Moana, stay on the ground now. Our people will need a chief, and
    there you are. 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  There you are! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  There comes a day, when you're gonna look around. And realize happiness is. 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  Where you are! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Consider the coconut! </p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  The what! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Consider its tree! </p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  We use each part of the coconut, it's all we need. 
</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>:  We make our nests from the fibers, the water is sweet inside. We use the leaves
    to build fires. We cook up the meat inside. 
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  Consider the coconuts. The trunks and the leaves! </p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  The island gives us what we need. </p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  And no one leaves. </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  That's right, we stay. We're safe we're well-provided. And when we look to the
    future. 
</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  There you are! </p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  You'll be OK. In time you'll learn just as I did. </p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  You must find happiness right where you are. </p>
<p>[giggling]</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>:  I like to dance with the water, the undertow and the waves, the water is
    mischevious. Ha! I like it how it misbehaves. The village may think I'm crazy, or say that I drift too
    far. But once you know what you like. Well, there you are. You are your father's daughter, stubbornness
    and pride. Mind what he says to remember. You may hear a voice inside. And if the voice starts to
    whisper, to follow the farthest star. Moana, that voice inside is who you are. 
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Dad! I was only looking at the boats. I wasn't gonna get on 'em.
</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: [sighs] Come on. There's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you
    here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. A place of Chiefs. That will come a
    time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father
    did. And his father, and every chief that has ever been. And on that day, when you add your stone, you
    will raise this whole island together. You are the future of our people, Moana. And they are not out
    there. They are right here. It's time to be who they need you to be.
</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  We make our nets from the fibers! We weave our nets from the fibers! The water is
    sweet inside! A real tasty treat inside! We use the leaves to build fires! We sing these songs in our
    choirs! We use the leaves to build fires! We sing these songs in our choirs! The village believes in us!
    The village believes! The island gives us what we need! 
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>:  And no one leaves! </p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  So here I'll stay! My home, my people beside me, and when I think of tomorrow.
    
</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  There we are! </p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  I'll lead the way! I'll have my people to guide me, we'll build our future
    together!&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>:  Where we are! </p>

<p><strong>Villager 3</strong>: I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock. He seems to lack the basic
    intelligence required for pretty much everything. Should we maybe just cook him?
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface. Far beneath in some cases. But
    I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye.
</p>
<p>[Heihei cawing]</p>
<p>[pecking]</p>
<p><strong>Villager 2</strong>: It's the harvest. This morning, I was husking the coconuts and...
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Well, we should clear the diseased trees and we will start a new grove. There.
</p>
<p><strong>Villager 2</strong>: Thanks, Moana. She's doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: This suits you.</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: Chief? [panting] There's something you need to see. Our traps in the east
    lagoon, they're pulling up less and less fish.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: Uh, we have. There's no fish.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Oh. Then we'll fish the far side of the island.</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: We tried.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: The windward side.</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: And the leeward side, the shallows, the channel. We've tried the whole
    lagoon. They're just gone.
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Have you tried using a different bait?</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: I don't think it's the bait. There's no fish. It seems like it's getting
    worse and worse.
</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Of course, I understand you have reason for concern. I will talk to the council.
    I'm sure we...
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What if we fish beyond the reef?</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: No one goes beyond the reef.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I know. But if there are no fish in the lagoon...</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Moana.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: And there's a whole ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: We have one rule.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: An old rule, when there were fish.</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: A rule that keeps us safe...</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: But Dad, I...</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: ...instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water.

<p><strong>Sina</strong>: Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad. Standing on a boat.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I didn't say go beyond the reef, because I want to be on the ocean.
</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: But you still do.</p>
<p>[Moana sighs]</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: He's hard on you because...</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Because he doesn't get me.</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: Because he was you. Drawn to the ocean. Down by the shore. He took a canoe, Moana.
    He crossed the reef...
</p>
<p>[thunder rumbling]</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: ...and found an unforgiving sea. Waves like mountains. His best friend begged to
    be on that boat. Your dad couldn't save him.
</p>
<p>[yelling]</p>
<p><strong>Sina</strong>: He's hoping he can save you. Sometimes who we wish we were, what we wish we could
    do, it's just not meant to be.
</p>
<p>[ Auli'l Cravalho: How Far I'll Go]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  I've been staring at the edge of the water. Long as I can remember. Never
    really knowing why. I wish I could be the perfect daughter, but I come back to the water. No matter how
    hard I try. Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make, every road leads back, to the
    place I know where I cannot go where I long to be. See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls
    me. And no one knows, how far it goes. If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me. One day I'll
    know. If I go, there's just no telling, how far I'll go. I know everybody on this island seems so happy
    on this island. Everything is by design. 
</p>
<p>[squeals]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  I know everybody on this island has a role on this island, so maybe I can roll
    with mine. I can lead witn pride, I can make us strong, I'll be satisfied, if I play along, but the
    voice inside, sings a different song, what is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea, it's
    blinding. But no one knows! How deep it goes! And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me!
    And let me know! What's beyond that line? Will I cross that line? The line where the sky meets the sea,
    it calls me! And no one knows, how far it goes! If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one
    day I'll know! How far I'll go!  Whoa.

    Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back. To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid
    voyaging. And now we have forgotton who we are. And the darkness has continued to spread, chasing away

    unknown, where I go alone where I long to be! See her light up the night in the sea she calls me! And

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Maui, demigod of the wind and sea, I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat.
    No. You will board my boat. Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my...

</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Hero of men.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea, hero of men. I
    interrupted. From the top. Hero of men. Go.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I am...</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Sorry, sorry, sorry. And women. Men and women. Both. All. Not a guy, girl thing.
    You know, Maui is a hero to all. You're doing great. [clicks tongue]

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [chuckles] I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.
</p>
<p>[whacking]</p>
<p>[groaning]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You are not my hero. And I'm not here so you can sign my oar! I'm here 'cause you
    stole the heart of Te Fiti! And you will board my boat, and sail across the sea and put it back!
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Um... Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me which is impossible beacause
    I got stuck here for a thousand years trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals. So you could
    have the power to create life itself. Yeah. So, what I believe you were trying to say is "Thank you."
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: "Thank you?"</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What? No, no, no! I didn't... I wasn't... Why would I ever say that? I mean...
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [chuckles] OK, OK.</p>
<p>[ Dwayne Johnson: You're Welcome]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>:  I see what's happening, yeah. You're face to face with greatness and it's
    strange. You don't even know how you feel. It's adorable. Well it's nice to see that humans never
    change. Open your eyes, let's begin. Yes, it's really me. It's Maui, breathe it in. I know it's a lot,
    the hair, the bod! When you're staring at a demigod! What can I say except you're welcome! For the
    tides, the sun, the sky! Hey, it's OK, it's OK, you're welcome! I'm just an ordinary demiguy! Hey! What
    has two thumbs and pulled up the sky? When you were wadding yay high? This guy! When the night gets
    cold, who stole you fire from down below? You're looking at him, yo! Oh, also I lassoed the sun. You're
    welcome! To stretch your days and bring you fun! Also I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome! To fill
    your sails and shake your trees. So what can I say except you're welcome! For the islands I pulled from
    the sea! There's no need to pray it's OK, you're welcome! Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me!
    You're welcome! You're welcome! Well, come to think of it! Kid, honestly I could go on and on I could
    explain every natural phenomenon! The tide, the grass, the ground! Oh that was Maui just messing around!
    I killed an eel, I buried its guts, sprouted a tree now you got coconuts! What's the lesson? What is the
    take away? Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway! And the tapestry here on my skin, is a map of
    the victories I win! Look where I've been I make everything happen! Look at that Mean Mini-Maui just
    tickety tappin'! Ha ha ha ha ha ha hey! Well anyway let me say you're welcome! 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  You're welcome! </p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>:  For the wonderful world you know! Hey, it's OK, it's OK, you're welcome!

<p><strong>Maui</strong>:  Well come to think of it, I gotta go! Hey it's your day to say you're welcome! 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  You're welcome! </p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>:  'Cause I'm gonna need that boat! I'm sailing away away, you're welcome! 
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:  You're welcome! </p>
<p>
    <strong>Maui</strong>:  'Cause Maui can do everything but float! You're welcome!

    that. It's a beautiful cave. She's gonna love it. And I'm going to love you in ma belly. Now, let's

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: No! No. [chuckles nervously] I'm not afraid.</p>
<p>[teeth chattering]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit. You, stop it. That is not a heart.
    It is a curse. The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky and I lost my hook. Get it away from
    me.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Get this away?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, OK? Stop that. I will smite you! You wanna get
    smote? Smotten? [grunting] Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life, it's a homing
    beacon of death. If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Moana</strong>: Come for this? The heart? You mean this heart right here?
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Don't, you can't raise your voice like that!</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Come and get it!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [Maui shushing] You are gonna get us killed!</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti, so you can put it back. Thank you. You're
    welcome.

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: They're kinda cute.</p>
<p>[beating the drums]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Ocean! Do something! Help us!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: The ocean doesn't help you, you help yourself! Tighten the halyard. Bind the
    stays! You can't sail?

<p>[drums beating loudly]</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Congratulations on not being dead, girlie. You surprise me. But I'm still not
    taking that thing back. You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta go through a whole ocean of bad. Not to
    mention Te K&acirc;. Lava monster? Ever defeat a lava monster?
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [grunts] [grunts] I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal. You can't
    restore that heart without me and me says no.
</p>
<p>[Heihei clucks]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I'm getting my hook. End of discussion.</p>
<p>[sighs]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You'd be a hero. That's what you're all about, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Little girl, I am a hero.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Maybe you were. But now, now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.
    The guy who cursed the world. You're no one's hero.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [scoffs] No one?</p>
<p>[clucks]</p>

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [Moana whispering] Maui! Maui! Maui! You're so amazing!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Maui</strong>: We'd never make it without my hook. Not past Te K&acirc;.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Then we get your hook. We get your hook, take out Te K&acirc;, restore the heart.
    Unless you don't wanna be Maui, demigod of the wind and sea. Hero to all?
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: First, we get my hook.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Then save the world. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Deal?</p>
<p>[yelps]</p>
<p>[splash]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Worth a shot. OK, we go east. To the lair of Tamatoa. If anyone has my hook, it's
    that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.
</p>
<p>[grunts]</p>
<p>[splashing]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Teach me to sail.</p>
<p>[blows raspberry]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: My job is to delieve Maui across the great ocean. I should... [grunts] I should
    be sailing.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: It's called wayfinding, princess. And it's not just sails and knots, it's seeing
    where you're going in your mind. Knowing where you are by knowing where you've been.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Moana</strong>: OK, first, I'm not a princess. I am the daughter of the chief.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Same difference.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: If you wear a dress, and you have an animao sidekick, you're a princess. You are
    not a wayfinder. You will never be a wayfinder, you will never be a... [winces] [groans]
</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: You are a bad person.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: If you can talk, you can teach. Wayfinding. [grunting] Lesson one. Hit it.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [groans] Pull the sheet. Not the sheet. No. Nope. Nope. No. Tried that one
    already. You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five. If the current's warm, you're going
    the right way.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: It's cold. Wait, it's getting warmer. [gasps] Aah! That is disgusting! What is
    wrong with you?
</p>
<p>[Maui chuckles]</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [groans] [gasps] We're here? See, told you I could do it! Motunui? I'm home?

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Tui</strong>: Moana!</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Enjoy your beauty rest? You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps, so they actually
    get where they need to go.
</p>
<p>[gasps]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Muscle up, buttercup. We're here.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it. He's a scavenger. Collects stuff. Think it makes him
    look cool. Ah! And for Tamatoa, trust me, my hook is the coolest collectible.
</p>
<p>[clucking]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: And he lives up there?</p>
<p>[bird screeching]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [Maui chuckles] No, no, no. That's just the entrance, to, um, Lalotai.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [gasps] Lalotai? [loudly] Realm of monsters? [clears her throat] We're going to
    the realm of monsters?
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [chuckles] We? No. Me. You are gonna stay here with the other chicken. [clucking]
</p>
<p>[Heihei clucking]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [Maui laughing] That's what I'm talking about. Gimmie some. Come on. That was a
    good one. How do you not get it? I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat. I know she's
    human, but that's not the... You know what? Forget it. Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you. 'Cause
    the it's not funny.

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [grunting] Hmm?</p>
<p>[Moana grunting]</p>
<p>[groans]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: So, daughter of the Chief, I thought you stayed in the village. You know, kissing
    babies and things. Hey, I'm just trying to understand why your people decided to send... How do I phrase
    this? You.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: My people didn't send me. The ocean did.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: The ocean? Makes sense. You're what, eight? Can't sail. Obvious choice.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: It chose me for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: If the ocean's so smart, why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?
    Or bring me my hook? The ocean's straight up hooky-dooks. But I'm sure it's not wrong about you. You're
    the Chosen One!
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [grunts] [gasps] The ocean chose you for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: So, not seeing an enterance.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Yes, because it only appears after a human sacrifice.

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [gasps] Sorry! I thought you were a monster... But I found your hook. And, you're
    right, this Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Stay.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What? No. I'm the one who found...</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Listen. For a thousand years, I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky,
    getting my hook and being awesome again. And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal who has no business
    inside of a monster cave, except... Except maybe as bait.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p>[drumbeat]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Wow! The shiny, glittery cave. And just like me it is covered in sparkly
    treasure. Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: You're not selling it!</p>
<p>
    <strong>Moana</strong>: [whispers] This is stupid! I'm just gonna walk up and get it!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Maui</strong>: You go up there, he will kill you. Just stick to the plan.
</p>
<p>[beating the makeshift drum]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Oh, when he shows up, keep him distracted. Make him talk about himself. He loves
    bragging about how great he is.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You two must get along swell.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: No, not since I ripped off his leg.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You ripped off his... Maui?</p>

<p>[yelps]</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: Ugh! It's a human! What are you doing down here, in the realm of the mons--
    Just pick an eye, babe. I can't-- I can't concentrate on what I'm saying if you keep... Yeah, pick one,
    pick one! You're a funny funny-looking little thing, aren't you?
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Don't! That's my gramma's!</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: [in mocking voice] "That's my gramma's!" I ate my Gramma! And it took a week,
    'cause she was absolutely humongous. Why are you here?
</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: 'Cause you're amazing! And we mortals have heard of the tale of the crab who
    became a legend! And I just had to know how you became so crabulous?
</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself? Because if you are, I will
    gladly do so.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: In song form!</p>
<p>[ Jamie Clement: Shiny]</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>:  Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam, I was a drab little crab once.
    Now I know I can be happy as a clam. Because I'm beautiful, baby. And did you granny say listen to your
    heart. Be you are on the inside. I need three words to tear her argument apart your granny lied! I'd
    rather be shiny! Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck! Scrub the deck! And make it look shiny! I
    will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck! Just a sec! Don't ya know. Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb they
    chase anything that glitters, beginners. Oh, and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that
    glitters! Mm, fish dinners! I just love free food, and you look like seafood! 
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Hey, crab cake! I'm back. It's Maui Time!</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Giant hawk? Coming up! Cheeeehoooo! Cheeeehoooo!</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p>[gasps]</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>:  Well, well, well. Little Maui's having trouble with his look, ya little
    semi-demi-mini-god. Ouch! What a terrible performance! Get the hook, get it? You don't swing it like you
    used to, man. Yet I have to give you credit for my start! And your tattoos on the outside for just like
    you I made myself a work of art! I'll never hide! I can't, I'm too shiny! Watch me dazzle like a diamond
    in the rough! Strut my stuff! My stuff is too shiny! Send your armies, but they'll never be enough! My
    shell's too tough, Maui, man! You can try, try, try, but you can't expect a demigod. To beat a decapod.
    Look it up. You will die, die, die, now it's time for me to take apart, your achin' heart. Far from the
    ones who abandoned you chasing the love of these humans who made you feel wanted. You tried to be tough,
    but your armor's just not hard enough! Maui! Now it's time to kick your heinie! Ever see someone so
    shiny! Soak it in, 'cause it's the last you'll ever see! C'est la vie mon ami! I'm so shiny! Now I eat
    you so prepare your final plea, just for me! You'll never be quite as shiny, you wish you were nice and
    shiny! 
</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I got something shiny for ya!</p>
<p>[spitting]</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: The heart of Te Fiti. You can't run from me! Oh, you can. You keep surprising
    me.
</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tamatoa</strong>: There's only so far you can get on those two little legs.
</p>
<p>[yells]</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: [laughing] The power of creation for a crustacean. Where is it? Where is it?
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: We gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: What about the heart?</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: He can have it. I've got a better one.</p>
<p><strong>Tamatoa</strong>: [laughing] Yes, I have the... Wait a minute. Argh! I see, she's taken a
    barnacle and she's covered it in bioluminescent algae as a diversion. [shattering]
</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>

<p><strong>Moana</strong>: We're alive! We're alive! [gasps]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Listen, I appreciate what you did down there.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Took guts.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: But...</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I'm sorry. I'm trying to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: No, no. [blowing raspberrry] No way!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Really? Because you're looking at me like I have a... [gasps] [sighs] ...shark
    head.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [chuckles] What? Do you have a shark head?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Look, the point is for a little girl, child, thing, whatever, who had no business
    being down there, you did me a solid. But you also almost died. And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.
    So, chances of beating Te K&acirc;? Bupkis. We're never making it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: It's not cursed.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Shark head.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [grunting] It is not cursed.</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>

    <strong>Maui</strong>:  What can I say except we're dead soon. We're dead soon. 
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Can you at least try?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Giant hawk.</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p>[thud]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>:  Hey, it's OK, it's OK, we're dead soon. </p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: All right, break time's over. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Why? Are you gonna give me a speech? Tell me I can beat Te K&acirc; 'cause I'm
    "Maui?" Take a hike, Tiny.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: How do you get your tattoos?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: They show up. When I earn them.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: How'd you earn that one? What's that for?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: That's man's discovery of Nunya.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What's Nunya?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Nunya business.</p>
<p>[tapping]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I'll just keep asking.</p>
<p>[tapping]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What's it for?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: You need to stop doing that.</p>
<p>[tapping]</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Back off.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Just tell me what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I said back off.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Is it why your hook's not working?</p>
<p>[grunting]</p>
<p>[splashing]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: [gasps] You don't want to talk, don't talk. You wanna throw me off the boat,
    throw me off. You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing, I know I don't. I have no idea why the
    ocean chose me. You're right. But my island is dying, so I am here. It's just me and you. And I want to
    help but I can't, if you don't let me. [sighs]
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I wasn't born a demigod. I had human parents. They, uh... They took one look and
    decided they don't want me. They threw me into the sea, like I was... nothing. Somehow, I was found by
    the gods. They gave me the hook. They made me Maui. And back to the humans I went. I gave them islands,
    fire, coconuts. [chuckles] Anything they could ever want.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: You took the heart for them. You did everything for them. So they'd love you.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: It was... never enough.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Maybe the gods found you for a reason. Maybe the ocean brought you to them
    because it saw someone who worthly of being saved. But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui. You
    are.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Hmm? OK, OK. [chuckles] I love you, too, buddy.</p>

<p>[singing continues]</p>
<p>[singing fades]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I figured it out. You know, the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands 'cause
    your ancestors would sail her seas and find 'em. All those new lands, new villages. It was the water
    that connected 'em all. And if I were the ocean, I think I'd be looking for a curly-haired non-princess
    to start that again.
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Probably should have
    saved it for Te Fiti.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I did. Moana of Motunui, I believe you have officialy delivered Maui across the
    great sea. [imitating cheering in a low voice] [cheering in a low voice] Moana! Moana! Moana! You're so
    amazing!
</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: We?</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong>: It was made by the gods. You can't fix it!</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Next time we'll be more careful. Te K&acirc; was stuck on the barrier islands.
    It's lava, it can't go in water. We can find a way around.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I'm not going back.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: We still have to restore the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: My hook is cracked. One more hit, and it's over.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Maui, you have to restore the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Without my hook, I am nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: That's not true!</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: [yells] Without my hook, I am nothing!</p>
<p>[shuddering]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: We&lsquo;re only here because you stole the heart in the first place.
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special and you believed it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Moana</strong>: [loudly] I am Moana of Motunui. You will board my boat...
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: Goodbye, Moana.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: ...sail scross the sea...</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: I'm not killing myself, so you can prove yourself you're something you're not!
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: ...and restore the heart of Te Fiti! The ocean chose me!
</p>
<p><strong>Maui</strong>: They chose wrong.</p>
<p>[zapping]</p>
<p>[screeching]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Maui! Why did you bring me here? I'm not the right person. You have to choose
    someone else. Choose someone else. Please. [sobbing] [cries] [whispers] No.
</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: You're a long ways past the reef.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Gramma?</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: Guess I chose the right tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Gramma! I tried, Gramma. I couldn't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>: It's not your fault. I never should have put so much on your shoulders. If you
    are ready to go home, I will be with you. Why do you hesitate?
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Gramma</strong>:  I know a girl from an island, she stands apart from the crowd. She loves the
    sea ane her people, she makes her whole family proud. Sometimes the world seems against you, the journey
    may leave a scar. But scars can heal and reveal just where you are. The people you love will change you
    the things you have learned will guide you. And nothing on earth can silence. The quiet voice still
    inside you. And when that voice starts to whisper, Moana, you've come so far. Moana, listen. Do you know
    who you are? 
</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>:  Who am I? I am a girl who loves my island, and the girl who lives the sea, it
    calls me. I am the daughter of the village chief, we are descended from voyagers. Who found their way
    across the world. They call me! I've delivered to us where we are, I have journeyed farther! I am
    everything I've learned and more, still it calls me! And the call isn't out there it all, it's inside
    me! It's like the tide, always falling and rising! I will carry you here in my heart, you remind me!
    That come what may, I know the way! I am Moana!

    sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
</p>
<p>[splashing]</p>
<p><strong>Moana</strong>: Te K&acirc; can't follow us into the water. We make it past the barrier islands,
    we make it to Te Fiti. None of which you understand, because you are a chicken.
