<p>```UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!</p>

<p>;;;oil fortune, converted himself from</p>
<p>;;;a gas-guzzler into an electric car,</p>
<p>;;;and has devoted his life to finding</p>
<p>;;;a renewable, clean-burning fuel!</p>

<p>;;;His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was</p>

<p>;;;It's time to find out. The racers</p>

<p>```Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright</p>

<p>```(TO HIMSELF)</p>
<p>;;;Speed. I am speed.</p>

<p>```A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him</p>

<p>;;;It's his cover. One of the best</p>
