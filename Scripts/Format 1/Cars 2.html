          A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a
          pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are
          visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel
          room.

          Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
          ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.

          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.

          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
<strong>                          NOSY PACER

</strong>           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
<strong>                          NOSY PACER

          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.

          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.

          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.

           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.

          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.

          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
<strong>                         STOPS:
</strong>                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
<strong>                         CRANE ---
</strong>                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
<strong>          PAST FINN ---
</strong>                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.

          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
<strong>                          ACER

</strong>           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.

<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
           thought I could make it this time,
           but...
           (he tries to start his
           engine, stalls)
           Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
           am I kidding? I'll always be a
           lemon.
                         
          Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
           again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
           look on the bright side: This is
           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           But you never leak oil.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
                         
<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Not yet.
                         
<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
<strong>           8.

<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
<strong>                          OTIS
</strong>           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
<strong>          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
</strong>                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup."
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.

<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           You sure you can handle it?

          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
                         
<strong>           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
</strong>           Mater!
                         
<strong>           MATER (O.S.)
</strong>           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.

</strong>           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.

<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

</strong>           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN

<strong>           MATER (O.S.)
</strong>           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
<strong>                          (TO HIMSELF)
</strong>           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater, you work here?
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?

           that too.

<strong>           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
</strong>           Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
<strong>           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
</strong>           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
<strong>           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
</strong>           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
<strong>           15.

          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
<strong>           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
</strong>           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
<strong>           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
</strong>           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
<strong>           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
</strong>           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.

</strong>           Miles, why not invite Lightning
           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
<strong>           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
</strong>           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
<strong>           MEL DORADO (ON TV)

<strong>           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
</strong>           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.
                         
          Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
          of the bar on an office phone.

<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           If he is, how you say "the bestest
           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?
                         
<strong>           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
</strong>           Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of
           his races. After two laps I am out
           cold.
                         
          Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
          since Mater started talking.
                         
<strong>           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
</strong>           That ain't what I meant.

          MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN

<strong>           CUT BACK TO:
</strong>                         
          THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
          they're watching Francesco on the television.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong><strong>                          (TO SALLY)
</strong>           Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
           His name is ---
                         
<strong>                          SALLY
</strong>           Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Wait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.
<strong>           18.

           there, Mr. San Francisco ---
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater?
                         
<strong>           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
</strong>           McQueen could drive circles around
           you.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           Driving in circles is all he can
           do, no?
                         
<strong>           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
</strong>           No! I mean yes. I mean he could
           beat you anywhere, anytime, any
           track.
                         
          On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
                         
          --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           Mel, can we move on? Francesco
           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.
                         
          ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Ha ha! That shows what you know.
           Dump trucks is dumb.
                         
          Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
          McQueen.
                         
<strong>           MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
</strong>           Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
           McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
           my best friend being insulted like
           that.

<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           McQueen! That was your best friend?
           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to
           prove it.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Those are strong words from a car
           that is so fragile.
                         
<strong>           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
</strong>           Fragil&eacute;!? He calls Francesco
           fragil&eacute;? Not so fast, McQueen!
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           "Not so fast." What is that, your
           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
                         
<strong>           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
</strong>           Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Well, I would love to. The only
           thing is my crew's off for the
           season so ---
                         
          A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
          flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
          away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
          Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.

</strong>           Pit stop.
                         
          McQueen turns back to the phone.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           You know what? They just got back.
           Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
                         
          The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
          booth where Sally waits. Off her look:

</strong>           I know, I know. I just got back.
           But we won't be long and ---
                         
<strong>                          SALLY
</strong>           Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
           got enough to do here. Mater's
           going to have a blast though.
           (off McQueen's silence)
           You're bringing Mater, right? You
           never bring him to any of your
           races.
                         
          McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
          drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
                         
<strong>                          SALLY
</strong>           Just let him sit in the pits, give
           him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
           thrill of a lifetime for him.
                         
          Mater arrives.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Your drinks, sir.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           I didn't taste it!
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           How'd you like to come and see the
           world with me?

</strong>                         
          - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
          Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
          well.
                         
          - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
          Tokyo, Japan.
                         
          - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
          Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---

          Red bawls.
                         
          - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
          awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
                         
          - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
          scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
          skyscrapers.
                         
          - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
          McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
                         
          - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
          Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
                         
          - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
          parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
                         
          The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---

          held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
          are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
          are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
                         
<strong>          INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
</strong>                         
          Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
          overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
          they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.

          It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
          now has no choice but to let Mater go.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

          MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
          pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
          his hook.
                         
<strong>                          MATER

          People turn at the noise he's making.

</strong>           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator

</strong>           Mater, look -- things are different
           over here. Which means maybe you
           should, you know, act a little
           different too.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Different than what?

</strong>           You need help? Shoot, why didn't
           you just say so? That's what a tow
           truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
           Mr. San Francisco!
                         
          FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           I'll introduce you.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater, no.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           (already on his way)

           already!
                         
          On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
           to meet ---
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Nice to meet you, Francesco.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
           very good-looking. Not as good as I
           thought, but you're good.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong><strong>                          (TO FRANCESCO)
</strong>           Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
           you?
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Anything for McQueen's friend.
                         
          As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
           sees this. She's Lightning
           McQueen's girlfriend.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Oooh.
<strong>           24.
</strong>                         
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           She's a big fan of yours.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Hey, she has good taste.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
           wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           You're right. She's a huge fan. She
           goes on and on about your open
           wheels here.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
           as going "on and on."
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Francesco is familiar with this
           reaction to Francesco. Women
           respect a car that has nothing to
           hide.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Yeah, uh...
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Let us have a toast.
                         
          McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Let's.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           (raising a drink)
           I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
           Miss Sally.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
           win tomorrow to her. So if we both
           do it, it's really not so special.
           Besides, I don't have a drink.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           I'll go get you one. You mind if I
           borrow a few bucks for one of them
           drinks?
<strong>           25.

<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           (could kill him)
           They're free, Mater.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
           here?
                         
          Mater ZIPS OFF.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           I should probably go keep an eye on
           him. See you at the race.
                         
          McQueen starts to leave.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           Yes, you will see Francesco. But
           not like this.
                         
          Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           You will see him like this, as he
           drives away from you.
                         
          Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           That's cute. So you had one of
           those made up for all the racers?
                         
<strong>                          FRANCESCO
</strong>           No.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Okay.
                         
          He rolls off.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           He is so getting beat tomorrow.

           introduce to you the competitors in
           the first-ever World Grand Prix.
           From Brazil. Number eight...
                         
          ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
          careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
                         
          --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
          Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
                         
          Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
          photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
          A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
          SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.

           Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
           have a message from London.

           I sent? What did they learn about
           the camera?
                         
<strong>                          HOLLEY
</strong>           It appears to be a standard
           television camera. They said if you
           could get closer photos next time,
           that would be great.

           platforms you were on? Turns out
           they're sitting on the biggest oil

</strong>           They'd been scrambling everyone's
           satellites. The Americans actually
           discovered it just before you did.
           They placed an agent on that
           platform, under deep cover. He was
           able to get a photo of the car
           who's running the entire operation.
                         
          The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.

           signal you when he's ready.

          Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
          Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
          Holley follows suit.

          He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
          assortment of drinks balanced.

          He approaches a sushi bar.

           How about that pistachio ice cream?
                         
          He refers to wasabi, of course.

          The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Uh, a little more, please.
           It is free, right?
           (the chef adds more)
           Keep it coming. A little more. Come

          As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
          Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
          making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.

          He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.

          Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
          Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.

          TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.

          McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
          Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
                         
<strong>                          MCQUEEN
</strong>           Mater, you have to get a hold of

          A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,

          The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
          FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
          freaks out.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
          GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
          BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
          underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,

          suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a

</strong>           But after microscopic examination,
           I have found that it has one small
           weakness. When hit with an

           His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
           one of the greatest dirt track

          Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
          momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
          past, Finn has disappeared.

</strong>           Strategia? Francesco needs no
           strategy, it's very simple. You
           start the race, wait for Lightning
           McQueen to choke, pass him, then
           win. Francesco always wins. It's
           boring.
                         
          McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
          notices something O.S.
                         
          McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
          moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.

<strong>           SIDDELEY (O.S.)
</strong>           Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
                         
          A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.

</strong>           Roger that.
                         
          Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a
          long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to
          create an accident.

          Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY
          descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts
          sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now
          raining down from above.
                         
<strong>                          MATER

          Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to
          stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
                         
<strong>                          MATER

          Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.

           That's a no-quit attitude right
           there.
                         
          Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
          him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
          pain.
                         
<strong>                          FINN
</strong>           Hold on, Sid!
                         
          Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
                         
          A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S
          TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
                         
          Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
                         
          --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
                         
          ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,
          where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his
          only hope.
                         
<strong>                          SIDDELEY

          Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets
          air.
                         
<strong>                          SIDDELEY

          Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes
          from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's
          PULLED in through the back hatch:

          Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened

          French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater
          FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.

          A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking
          for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.

          Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in
          a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.

</strong>           Tomber was doing 20 to life in a

           each other, you're both old. So.
                         
          Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of
          Tomber.
                         
<strong>                          HOLLEY
</strong>           There you go, informant. Inform us.
                         
          Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
                         
<strong>                          TOMBER
</strong>           That is the worst motor ever made.
                         
          Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
                         
<strong>                          TOMBER
</strong>           Wait. That oil filter... those

</strong>           No idea. He's my best customer, but
           he always does his business over
           the phone. I was always wondering
           why he needs so many parts. Now I

          Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
          PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.

           loser cars.
                         
          Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as
          the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.

           broken down. If one of you would
           help I would be so thankful.
                         
          IVAN, AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK (the one Holley and Finn
          prepped Mater to impersonate), drives forward.
                         
<strong>           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
</strong>           Sounds like you need some "roadside
           assistance".
                         
<strong>                          ANOTHER HUGO
</strong>           She was talking to me, Ivan.
<strong>           82.
</strong>                         
                         
<strong>           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
</strong>           Oh really? Prove it.
                         
<strong>                          HOLLEY
</strong>           No, no, don't fight over me.
                         
          Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.
                         
<strong>                          HOLLEY
</strong>           Signore Tow Truck, per favore?

</strong>                         
          MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a
          corner.
                         
<strong>           FINN (V.O.)
</strong>           Get ready, Mater.
<strong>                          CUT TO:
</strong>                         
          FINN, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.
                         
<strong>                          FINN
</strong>           You're on any moment now.
<strong>           CUT BACK TO:
</strong>                         
          MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           I don't know about this, Finn.
           What if I screw things up?
                         
<strong>           FINN (OVER RADIO)
</strong>           Impossible. Just apply the same
           level of dedication you've been
           using to play the "idiot tow truck"
           and you'll be fine.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           It's just that them guys look
           pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
           say "idiot"? Is that how you see
           me?
                         
<strong>           FINN (OVER RADIO)
</strong>           That's how everyone sees you. Isn't
           that the idea? I tell you, that's
           the genius of it. No one realizes
           they're being fooled because
           they're too busy laughing at the
           fool. Brilliant.
                         
          While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own
          reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself
          with new eyes.

          SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley's ZAPPERS.

          Mater, now disguised as Ivan the Tow Truck, approaches the
          Hugos. Another LIMO CAR CARRIER arrives.
                         
<strong>                          ALEXANDER HUGO
</strong>           It's the boss! He is coming!
                         
          The carrier parks and the back opens. VICTOR HUGO waits.
                         
<strong>                          VICTOR HUGO
</strong>           Ivan!
                         
          Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.
                         
<strong>                          VICTOR HUGO
</strong>           Ivan, why do you insult me so by
           making me wait?
                         
          Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of
          the casino.
                         
          ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors
          everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display.
                         
<strong>                          HOLLEY

          corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The
          largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater
          out of his funk.

          The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.
                         
<strong>           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
</strong>           That's because it is, Mater. Now,
           be careful what you say.
                         
<strong>                          MATER
</strong>           Why is that? What do you mean don't
           talk to you?
           (more talking from Holley
           which we cannot hear)
           So you want me to stop talking to

          We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is
          MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points
          of view. He doesn't like what he sees.

          - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone
          else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:

          Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
                         
          Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
          themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.

           And what's happened to McQueen is
           `cause I'm such a big one. This is
           all my fault.

          He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
          toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---

          The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire ROLLS
          onto the detonator. But he holds back ever so slightly so as
          not to jump the gun.

</strong>           It was you leaking oil at the party
           in Japan. You just blamed it on me.

          McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
          forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.

           full blast, McQueen hanging on for
           dear life when suddenly them two
           nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
           guns drawed. We was goners. But
           then out of nowhere, this beautiful
           spy car swoops in from the sky to

          The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
          right below her, driving up the street.

           Allinol was actually gasoline. And
           Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode.

</strong>           If you're implying that I switched
           out that rotgut excuse for
           alternative fuel with my all-
           natural, sustainable, organic
           biofuel just because I never
           trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,
