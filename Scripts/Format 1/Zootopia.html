<p>IN BLACK --</p>

<p>   We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A</p>
<p>   timpani bangs an ominous beat.</p>

<p>   FADE IN ON:</p>


<p>   A JUNGLE - NIGHT</p>

<p>   A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest,</p>
<p>   frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (V.O.)</p>
<p>;;;Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!</p>
<p>;;;Thousands of years ago, these were</p>
<p>;;;the forces that ruled our world. A</p>
<p>;;;world where prey were scared of</p>
<p>;;;predators. And predators had an</p>
<p>;;;uncontrollable biological urge to</p>
<p>;;;maim and maul and...</p>

<p>   The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows,</p>
<p>   attacks the bunny, who screams--</p>

<p>```CUT TO:</p>


<p>   INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT</p>

<p>   The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage</p>
<p>   production.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Blood, blood, blood!</p>

<p>   Reams of red papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; entrails ooze from the bunny. And</p>
<p>   when those run out-- projectile ketchup.</p>

<p>   Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS,</p>
<p>   10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner</p>
<p>   reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;And death.</p>

<p>   The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as</p>
<p>   BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Back then, the world was divided in</p>
<p>;;;two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.</p>
<p>```2.</p>


<p>TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY.</p>
<p>The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands</p>
<p>on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags</p>
<p>them underneath with her.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;But over time, we evolved, and</p>
<p>;;;moved beyond our primitive savage</p>
<p>;;;ways.</p>

<p>A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow</p>
<p>on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage.</p>
<p>Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing</p>
<p>white muumuus, too.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Now, predator and prey live in</p>
<p>;;;harmony.</p>

<p>Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;And every young mammal has</p>
<p>;;;multitudinous opportunities.</p>

<p>___ASTRONAUT SHEEP</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, I don't have to cower in a</p>
<p>;;;herd anymore.</p>

<p>The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade</p>
<p>astronaut costume.</p>

<p>___ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Instead I can be an astronaut.</p>

<p>Catmull plays a slide whistle.</p>

<p>___ACTUARY JAGUAR</p>
<p>;;;I don't have to be a lonely hunter</p>
<p>;;;any more.</p>

<p>The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit.</p>

<p>___ACTUARY</p>
<p>;;;Today I can hunt for tax</p>
<p>;;;exemptions. I'm gonna be an</p>
<p>;;;actuary!</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;And I can make the world a better</p>
<p>;;;place! I am going to be...</p>

<p>Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box.</p>
<p>Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM.</p>
<p>```3.</p>


<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;A police officer!</p>

<p>Judy's parents, BONNIE &amp; STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid,</p>
<p>GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Bunny cop. That is the most</p>
<p>;;;stupidest thing I ever heard.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;It may seem impossible to small</p>
<p>;;;minds--</p>
<p>```(points at Gideon)</p>
<p>;;;I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.</p>

<p>Catmull drops down a backdrop showing a bright city skyline.</p>
<p>He hits play on an uplifting song.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;But just 211 miles away stands the</p>
<p>;;;great city of Zootopia! Where our</p>
<p>;;;ancestors first joined together in</p>
<p>;;;peace, and declared that anyone can</p>
<p>;;;be anything! Thank you and good</p>
<p>;;;night!</p>

<p>Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on</p>
<p>organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned.</p>


<p>EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY</p>

<p>A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all</p>
<p>aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces</p>
<p>along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Judy, you ever wonder how your mom</p>
<p>;;;and me got to be so darn happy?</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Nope.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Well, we gave up on our dreams and</p>
<p>;;;we settled, right Bon?</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We</p>
<p>;;;settled hard.</p>
<p>```4.</p>


<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;See, that's the beauty of</p>
<p>;;;complacency, Jude. If you don't try</p>
<p>;;;anything new, you'll never fail.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;I like trying, actually.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;What your father means, hon, is</p>
<p>;;;it's gonna be difficult--</p>
<p>;;;impossible even-- for you to become</p>
<p>;;;a police officer.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Right. There's never been a bunny</p>
<p>;;;cop.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;No.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Bunnies don't do that.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Never.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Never.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be</p>
<p>;;;the first one. Because I am gonna</p>
<p>;;;make the world...</p>
<p>```(parkours against a</p>
<p>```vendor's stand)</p>
<p>;;;A better place!</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;OR... um, heck, you wanna talk</p>
<p>;;;about making the world a better</p>
<p>;;;place--</p>

<p>The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which</p>
<p>is manned by too many children to count.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;--no better way to do it than</p>
<p>;;;becoming a carrot farmer.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yes! Your dad, me, your 275</p>
<p>;;;brothers and sisters-- we're</p>
<p>;;;changing the world.</p>
<p>```5.</p>


<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yep.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;One carrot at a time...</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Amen to that. Carrot farming is a</p>
<p>;;;noble profession.</p>

<p>Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She</p>
<p>remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in</p>
<p>;;;the ground.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Ahh, at one with the soil.</p>

<p>We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now.</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;You get it. I mean, it's great to</p>
<p>;;;have dreams.</p>

<p>___STU HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, just as long as you don't</p>
<p>;;;believe in em too much.</p>
<p>```(finally noticing Judy's</p>
<p>```absence)</p>
<p>;;;Where in the heck'd she go?</p>

<p>ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon</p>
<p>Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Gimme your tickets right now, or</p>
<p>;;;I'm gonna kick your meek little</p>
<p>;;;sheep butt.</p>

<p>___SHARLA</p>
<p>;;;Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?</p>

<p>Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Hey!</p>

<p>Judy charges toward the danger.</p>
<p>```6.</p>


<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;You heard her. Cut it out.</p>

<p>Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Nice costume, loser. What crazy</p>
<p>;;;world are you living in where you</p>
<p>;;;think a bunny could be a cop?</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Kindly return my friends' tickets.</p>

<p>Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Come and get `em.... But watch out,</p>
<p>;;;`cause I'm a fox-- and like you</p>
<p>;;;said in your dumb little stage</p>
<p>;;;play, us predators used to eat</p>
<p>;;;prey. And that killer instinct's</p>
<p>;;;still in our Dunnahh.</p>

<p>___TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID</p>
<p>```(sotto, to Gideon)</p>
<p>;;;Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's</p>
<p>;;;pronounced D-N-A.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Don't tell me what I know, Travis.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;You don't scare me, Gideon.</p>

<p>Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals</p>
<p>flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the</p>
<p>thugs alone.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;You scared now?</p>

<p>Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch.</p>

<p>___TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID</p>
<p>;;;Lookit her nose twitch. She is</p>
<p>;;;scared!</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY</p>
<p>;;;Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --</p>

<p>Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind</p>
<p>legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood.</p>
<p>```7.</p>


<p>___GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, you don't know when to quit, do</p>
<p>;;;ya?</p>

<p>He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her,</p>
<p>drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared</p>
<p>friends behind the tree.</p>

<p>___GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I want you to remember this moment--</p>
<p>;;;the next time you think you will</p>
<p>;;;ever be anything more than just a</p>
<p>;;;stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.</p>

<p>Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The</p>
<p>prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from</p>
<p>her cheek. She fights tears, defeated.</p>

<p>___GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY</p>
<p>;;;That looks bad.</p>

<p>___SHARLA</p>
<p>;;;Are you okay, Judy?</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.</p>

<p>Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Here you go.</p>

<p>___SHARLA</p>
<p>;;;Wow! You got our tickets!</p>

<p>___GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY</p>
<p>;;;You're awesome, Judy!</p>

<p>___SHARLA</p>
<p>;;;Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know</p>
<p>;;;what he's talkin' `bout.</p>

<p>___YOUNG JUDY</p>
<p>;;;Well, he was right about one</p>

<p>EXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY</p>

<p>Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as</p>
<p>MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN</p>
<p>;;;Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12</p>
<p>;;;unique ecosystems within its city</p>
<p>;;;limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara</p>
<p>;;;Square, Rainforest District, to</p>

<p>;;;master all of them before you hit</p>
<p>;;;the streets-- or guess what?</p>
<p>```(to Hopps)</p>
<p>;;;You'll be dead!</p>

<p>IN SAHARA SQUARE SIMULATOR:</p>

<p>Hopps struggles through the sand.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN(CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Scorching sandstorm. You're dead,</p>
<p>;;;bunny bumpkin!</p>

<p>ON THE VINE-COVERED MONKEY BARS:</p>

<p>Hopps swings across the bars, simulating the RAINFOREST</p>
<p>DISTRICT. She falls off, landing face first in the mud.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot</p>

<p>TUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL:</p>

<p>Judy and the cadets sprint toward the wall. The CLAWED</p>
<p>ANIMALS dig into the ice wall. Hopps slides off.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Frigid ice wall. You're dead, farm</p>

<p>IN THE BOXING RING:</p>

<p>Hopps gets in the ring with a BIG BISON.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;E-normous criminal.</p>

<p>Hopps gets punched in the nose.</p>

<p>THREE QUICK CUTS OF FAILURE:</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Dead! / Dead! / Dead!</p>

<p>IN THE TOILET:</p>

<p>Hopps ruses into a stall. The toilet is considerably larger</p>
<p>than she is. She shuts the door. We see her climb up the</p>
<p>toilet. In the next stall, we see the feet of a Hippo.</p>

<p>Then, KERSPLASH! Hopps falls into the toilet.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff</p>
<p>;;;butt!</p>

<p>HOPPS ON HER OWN--</p>

<p>She runs at sunset-- after everyone else has called it a day.</p>
<p>We HEAR the drill instructor's voice echoing in her mind.</p>

<p>___MAJOR FRIEDKIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!</p>

<p>Then those of her parents...</p>

<p>OVERNIGHT, IN THE BARRACKS:</p>

<p>Hopps stays up late studying, doing sit ups.</p>

<p>ON THE ICE WALL:</p>

<p>Hopps bounds up the wall, jumps off of the backs of the big</p>
<p>animals and makes it over, impressing the Major Friedkin.</p>

<p>IN THE RING:</p>
<p>```10.</p>


<p>Hopps dodges a few swings. The Bison misses. Hopps bounds</p>
<p>over him and uses his momentum-- kicking his other hand into</p>
<p>his face, knocking him down.</p>

<p>A MONTAGE --</p>

<p>As Hopps takes the train, it rounds a curve. She looks up.</p>
<p>Her eyes light up. There in the distance is...</p>


<p>EXT. ZOOTOPIA CITY - ESTABLISHING</p>

<p>...THE UNBELIEVABLE ANIMAL METROPOLIS of ZOOTOPIA, which is</p>
<p>comprised of amazing habitat "boroughs." The train whips past</p>
<p>TUNDRATOWN, SAVANNA CENTRAL, RAINFOREST DISTRICT,</p>
<p>MEADOWLANDS, SAHARA SQUARE, etc.</p>


<p>INT. ZOOTOPIA CENTRAL STATION - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps spills out of the train... and we are now in a MULTI-</p>
<p>SCALE ENVIRONMENT: everything from mice to elephants.</p>
<p>```15.</p>


<p>EXT. DOWNTOWN ZOOTOPIA - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps emerges into the main Zootopia central plaza. It's an</p>
<p>amazing, magnificent place.</p>

<p>A JUMBOTRON featuring a gazelle pop star, GAZELLE, blares its</p>
<p>message in a loop.</p>

<p>___GAZELLE</p>
<p>;;;I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia!</p>

<p>```CUT TO:</p>


<p>INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY</p>

<p>DHARMA ARMADILLO, Hopps's older ARMADILLO LANDLADY, opens the</p>
<p>door to Hopps' new apartment-- which we can't see yet.</p>

<p>___DHARMA ARMADILLO</p>
<p>;;;And welcome to the Grand Pangolin</p>
<p>;;;Arms. "Luxury Apartments with</p>
<p>;;;Charm."</p>

<p>Hopps discovers the room is a tiny, crappy studio apartment.</p>

<p>___DHARMA ARMADILLO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Complimentary de-lousing once a</p>
<p>;;;month.</p>
<p>```(handing over the keys)</p>
<p>;;;Don't lose your key.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Thank you!</p>

<p>As Dharma leaves, Hopps' volatile, artsy NEIGHBORS, KUDU and</p>
<p>ORYX POOTOSSER, pass by in the hall.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Oh hi, I'm Judy! Your new neighbor!</p>

<p>___KUDU POOTOSSER</p>
<p>;;;Yeah? Well we're loud.</p>

<p>___ORYX POOTOSSER</p>
<p>;;;Don't expect us to apologize for</p>
<p>;;;it.</p>

<p>Before Hopps can respond, they're gone, leaving Hopps alone.</p>
<p>She looks around... blank-faced so it's tough to read her</p>
<p>emotions.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Greasy walls... rickety bed...</p>
<p>```16.</p>


<p>___KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Shut up!</p>

<p>___ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;You shut up!</p>

<p>___KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;No! You shut up!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Crazy neighbors...</p>
<p>```(big smile as she flops on</p>
<p>```the bed)</p>
<p>;;;I love it!</p>

<p>As the shouting continues, she stretches out on her bed,</p>
<p>exhausted but overjoyed.</p>


<p>WAKE UP MONTAGE - MORNING</p>

<p>Quick, rhythmic cuts of:</p>

<p>- Alarm clock: Beep. Beep. Beep.</p>

<p>- Dressing: Vest. Badge. Belt.</p>

<p>On the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy</p>
<p>glances at it and smirks-- taking it would be silly-- she</p>
<p>walks out of frame. HOLD on the table. One second. Then</p>
<p>Judy's hand comes back into frame and grabs the Repellent.</p>


<p>INT. ZOOTOPIA POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING</p>

<p>Utter mayhem. COPS parade PERPS through the lobby-- one is</p>
<p>wearing cuffs and a plastic (not scary) safety muzzle, he</p>
<p>complains to the BEAR COP marching him by.</p>

<p>___LEOPARD</p>
<p>;;;C'mon! He bared his teeth first.</p>

<p>We land at the front desk and find CLAWHAUSER, a PUDGY</p>
<p>CHEETAH COP, happily eating a bowl of Lucky Chomps cereal.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (O.C.)</p>
<p>;;;Scuse me! Down here? Hi.</p>

<p>Clawhauser leans over the desk to find Hopps.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>
<p>;;;O-M goodness! They really did hire</p>
<p>;;;a bunny. What?!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(a little wince)</p>
<p>;;;Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know,</p>
<p>;;;but a bunny can call another bunny</p>
<p>;;;"cute," but when other animals do</p>

<p>```(gasps, realizing)</p>
<p>;;;I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin</p>

<p>;;;It's okay-- oh, you've actually</p>
<p>;;;you've actually got a-- there's a--</p>
<p>;;;in your neck-- the fold-- the--</p>

<p>Clawhauser removes a small donut from under some neck fat.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>
<p>;;;Oh, there you went, you little</p>
<p>;;;dickens!</p>

<p>He crams the donut into his mouth.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(awkwardly laughing)</p>
<p>;;;I should get to roll call, so...</p>
<p>;;;which way do I?</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>
<p>;;;Oh! Bullpen's over there to the</p>
<p>;;;left.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Great, thank you!</p>

<p>Clawhauser watches admiringly as she heads to the bullpen.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>
<p>```(to himself, wistful)</p>
<p>;;;Aw... That poor little bunny's</p>
<p>;;;gonna get eaten alive.</p>
<p>```18.</p>


<p>INT. ZPD - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Hopps enters the bullpen, by far the smallest animal in the</p>
<p>room: rhinos, buffalo, hippos, elephants, etc. Hopps holds</p>
<p>her paw out to a tough RHINO, MCHORN.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to</p>
<p>;;;make the world a better place?</p>

<p>McHorn gives Hopps a reluctant fist bump, nearly knocking her</p>
<p>off the chair.</p>

<p>___OFFICER HIGGINS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;TEN HUT!</p>

<p>In walks CHIEF BOGO, a gruff CAPE BUFFALO. He takes the dais.</p>
<p>Everyone snaps to attention and starts stomping the floor.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;All right, all right. Everybody</p>
<p>;;;sit.</p>

<p>As Hopps sits, she disappears below the DESK that is meant</p>
<p>for a rhino.</p>

<p>___BOGO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I've got three items on the docket.</p>
<p>;;;First... we need to acknowledge the</p>
<p>;;;elephant in the room.</p>
<p>```(nods to ELEPHANT)</p>
<p>;;;Francine, happy birthday.</p>

<p>An elephant, FRANCINE, blushes as other cops clap.</p>

<p>___BOGO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Number two: There are some new</p>
<p>;;;recruits with us I should</p>
<p>;;;introduce. But I'm not going to,</p>
<p>;;;because I don't care. Finally...</p>

<p>He turns to a push pin-pocked MAP that's covered in photos of</p>
<p>MISSING MAMMALS. Hopps's eyes go wide.</p>

<p>___BOGO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;...We have 14 missing mammal cases.</p>
<p>;;;All predators, from a giant polar</p>
<p>;;;bear, to a teensy little otter. And</p>
<p>;;;City Hall is right up my tail to</p>
<p>;;;find them. This is priority number</p>
<p>;;;one. Assignments!</p>

<p>HIGGINS hands Bogo a stack of CASE FILES. Bogo puts on his</p>
<p>reading glasses, examining the files as he assigns cases.</p>
<p>```19.</p>


<p>___BOGO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer,</p>
<p>;;;Delgato-- your teams take Missing</p>

<p>;;;Sahara Square. Officers Higgins,</p>
<p>;;;Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And</p>
<p>;;;finally, our first bunny, Officer</p>
<p>;;;Hopps.</p>

<p>Hopps sits up, expectant but steely. Bogo looks at the final</p>
<p>case file in his hand. He takes a dramatic breath, then:</p>

<p>___BOGO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Parking Duty. Dismissed!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Parking duty?</p>
<p>```(runs after Bogo)</p>
<p>;;;Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?</p>

<p>Bogo looks around... then down to find Hopps.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Sir, you said there were 14 missing</p>
<p>;;;mammal cases?</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;So.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;So I can handle one. You probably</p>
<p>;;;forgot, but I was top of my class</p>
<p>;;;at the academy.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;Didn't forget. Just don't care.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Sir, I'm not just some "token"</p>
<p>;;;bunny.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;Well, then writing a hundred</p>
<p>;;;tickets a day should be easy.</p>

<p>He goes, slamming the door behind him. Judy stomps her foot.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write</p>
<p>;;;100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200</p>
<p>;;;tickets!</p>

<p>```(then, to the closed door)</p>
<p>;;;Before noon!</p>


<p>INT. / EXT. METER MAID CART - DAY</p>

<p>Hopps dons a vest, buckles her seat belt, floors the pedal</p>
<p>and... takes off at 2 miles an hour. Which leads to a</p>

<p>PARKING METER MONTAGE --</p>

<p>Hopps zooms past a row of cars, marking their tires. Cruising</p>
<p>the streets, her super-sensitive ears hear a meter ding. She</p>
<p>slams her brakes-- then proudly issues Ticket #1.</p>

<p>Ding! Another meter goes off. Then another. And another.</p>
<p>She's on a roll. She looks down at her counter. It's at 200.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Boom! 200 tickets before noon.</p>

<p>A final ding... Reveal: her own traffic cart is at an expired</p>
<p>meter. Hopps rolls her eyes and writes herself a ticket.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;201.</p>

<p>As Hopps puts the ticket on her windshield, she hears a voice</p>
<p>across the street:</p>

<p>___TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Hey, watch where you're going, Fox!</p>

<p>Hopps looks across the street to see... a RED FOX. Hopps</p>
<p>looks at him, a little suspicious.</p>

<p>The Fox looks around, then slinks into a caf&eacute;. Hopps runs</p>
<p>across the street and peeks in the window. It's an ice cream</p>
<p>parlor, but... the FOX IS GONE.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(sotto)</p>
<p>;;;Where'd he go...</p>


<p>INT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Elephants scoop ice cream with their trunks, suck up nuts</p>
<p>with their trunks. It's cute but also disgusting. As Hopps</p>
<p>enters, she spots the fox, NICK WILDE, at the front of the</p>
<p>line and overhears the proprietor, JERRY, addressing him.</p>
<p>```21.</p>


<p>___JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.</p>
<p>;;;Listen, I don't know what you're</p>
<p>;;;doing skulking around during</p>
<p>;;;daylight hours, but I don't want</p>
<p>;;;any trouble in here... So hit the</p>
<p>;;;road.</p>

<p>Hopps unsnaps the holster of her PINK FOX REPELLENT.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;I'm not looking for any trouble</p>
<p>;;;either, sir. I simply want to buy a</p>
<p>;;;Jumbo Pop for my little boy.</p>

<p>Ready for action, slowly creeping forward, Hopps's expression</p>
<p>changes when she sees that Nick is with his TODDLER SON.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(to the boy)</p>
<p>;;;You want the red or the blue, pal?</p>

<p>Staring at the cute little boy, Hopps is embarrassed by her</p>
<p>impulse. She snaps the Repellent holster and begins to leave.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(disgusted with herself)</p>
<p>;;;I'm such a...</p>

<p>___JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.</p>
<p>;;;Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen,</p>
<p>;;;buddy, what? There aren't any fox</p>
<p>;;;ice cream joints in your part of</p>
<p>;;;town?</p>

<p>Hopps suddenly stops. Her ears go up and she turns around.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Uh, no no, there are. There are.</p>
<p>;;;It's just, my boy--</p>
<p>```(tousles boy's hair)</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Well, I don't wanna cause you any</p>

<p>He turns to go. Hopps slaps some money on the counter.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Keep the change.</p>


<p>EXT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Hopps has the Toddler's hand. Nick holds a HUGE JUMBO-POP.</p>

<p>Hopps walks off with a spring in her step.</p>


<p>EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - DAY</p>

<p>Hopps continues to write tickets. As she leaves a ticket on</p>
<p>another car, she can see a few blocks away. It's NICK and his</p>
<p>KID. Hopps gives them a wave, but they don't notice her.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh! Hey, little toot toot--</p>

<p>Hopps realizes they are melting their jumbo-pop in the hot</p>
<p>sun, channeling the juice into jugs. Huh? Nick and his kid</p>
<p>pack the jugs into a van and NICK'S SON gets in the driver's</p>
<p>seat. They drive off, passing Hopps, who stares, confused.</p>


<p>EXT. TUNDRATOWN - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps follows them to... Tundratown, where Nick's "son" uses</p>
<p>his little paw prints to create molds they pour the popsicle</p>
<p>juice into, creating dozens of smaller popsicles. Hopps looks</p>
<p>on, scandalized.</p>
<p>```25.</p>


<p>EXT. SAVANNAH CENTRAL - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps watches them resell the "Pawpsicles" at marked-up</p>
<p>prices to LEMMINGS... when one buys one, they all do.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!</p>

<p>Nick rakes in the cash. As the lemmings leave, they throw</p>
<p>their used popsicle sticks into a RECYCLING BIN. A second</p>
<p>later, Nick's "son," FINNICK, emerges from the bin with a</p>
<p>bundle of used popsicle sticks. Hopps is mortified.</p>


<p>EXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps watches Nick plop down a big bundle of USED POPSICLE</p>
<p>STICKS in front of a MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER.</p>

<p>___MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;The color? Uh... It's redwood.</p>

<p>Hopps has now graduated to genuine anger.</p>


<p>EXT. OUTSIDE LITTLE RODENTIA - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick hands Finnick a wad of cash.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;39...40. There you go. Way to work</p>

<p>Nick points behind Hopps. She turns... no one. She turns</p>
<p>back. Nick is gone-- his tail disappears around a corner.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>

<p>INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - EVENING</p>

<p>CLOSE ON HER WELCOME MAT: Hopps wipes off her cement covered</p>
<p>feet. Then she enters</p>

<p>THE APARTMENT --</p>

<p>Hopps turns on the radio. Everybody Hurts plays. She changes</p>
<p>the station. A sadder song comes on. She changes the station</p>
<p>repeatedly, each song progressively sadder. Finally, she</p>
<p>lands on a treacly instrumental that will score the scene.</p>

<p>She puts in a microwave dinner: CARROTS FOR ONE. Hopps takes</p>
<p>her food (A SINGLE CARROT) and sits at a small table.</p>

<p>Her phone rings. INSERT: MOM &amp; DAD FACETIME. Hopps shakes her</p>
<p>head, sighs, then puts on a fake smile and answers.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh hey, it's my parents!</p>

<p>___BONNIE HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!</p>

<p>THE FACETIME cuts between Bonnie on her phone. Stu will pop</p>

<p>Off Judy's exhausted look, we:</p>

<p>```CUT TO:</p>


<p>EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - THE NEXT DAY</p>

<p>Hopps, on meter maid duty, thunks a ticket on a windshield.</p>

<p>___MOOSE</p>
<p>;;;I was 30 seconds over!</p>

<p>Another meter dings, Hopps puts another ticket on a very</p>
<p>small windshield.</p>

<p>___ANGRY GERBIL LADY</p>
<p>;;;Ugh! Yeah you're a real hero, lady!</p>
<p>```31.</p>


<p>DING! Another ticket down. A MOTHER HIPPO picks up the</p>
<p>ticket, her SMALL CHILD looks right at Hopps.</p>

<p>___HIPPO CHILD</p>
<p>;;;My mommy says she wishes you were</p>
<p>;;;dead.</p>

<p>___ANGRY DRIVER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Un-cool, rabbit. My tax dollars pay</p>
<p>;;;your salary.</p>


<p>INT. METER MAID CART</p>

<p>After what has clearly been a series of these encounters,</p>
<p>Hopps repeatedly bangs her head on the steering wheel.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(less convinced with each</p>
<p>```utterance)</p>
<p>;;;I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I</p>
<p>;;;am a real cop. I am a real cop...</p>

<p>___FRANTIC PIG (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Hey!</p>

<p>Suddenly, a PIG bangs on the cart's window. Hopps startles.</p>

<p>___FRANTIC PIG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;You! Bunny!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(rote)</p>
<p>;;;Sir, if you have a grievance, you</p>

<p>;;;It was just robbed! Look, he's</p>
<p>;;;getting away! Well are you a cop or</p>

<p>Hopps sees a WEASEL running with a bag of stolen goods.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(snapping out of it)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I</p>
<p>;;;got this!</p>


<p>EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Hopps jumps out and gives chase-- ditching her silly vest.</p>
<p>```32.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Stop! Stop in the name of the law!</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON</p>
<p>;;;Catch me if you can, Cottontail!</p>

<p>The chase is on. McHorn screeches up in his cop car.</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Whoa. Coming through!</p>

<p>___MCHORN</p>
<p>;;;This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-</p>

<p>Hopps slides across his hood.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in</p>
<p>;;;pursuit!</p>

<p>Hopps chases the Weasel, who races through Savannah Central.</p>
<p>As Hopps advances, the Weasel ducks into... LITTLE RODENTIA.</p>
<p>Thanks to her small size, Hopps follows him in.</p>

<p>___HOPPS(CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;You! Freeze!</p>

<p>___MCHORN</p>
<p>```(arriving, but too big to</p>
<p>```enter)</p>
<p>;;;Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real</p>

<p>EXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Hopps emerges in Little Rodentia, teeming with tiny rodents.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Stop!</p>

<p>Hopps spots the Weasel, who's using two mouse cars as skates.</p>
<p>She chases after him, smashing through Little Rodentia. As</p>
<p>the Weasel jumps off the top of a mouse building, he knocks</p>
<p>it over, but Hopps is able to save them from crashing.</p>

<p>Resuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing</p>
<p>precariously in the midst of a large group of mice.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through!</p>
<p>;;;`Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon...</p>
<p>```33.</p>


<p>Hopps locates Weaselton, who's safely making his escape on</p>
<p>the top of a tiny mouse train.</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON</p>
<p>;;;Bon voyage, flat foot!</p>

<p>But Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him</p>
<p>off the train. Rodents scream and run amidst the chaos.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Hey! Stop right there!</p>

<p>The Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps.</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON</p>
<p>;;;Have a donut, coppah!</p>

<p>But the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out</p>
<p>of "Mousies."</p>

<p>___FRU FRU SHREW</p>
<p>;;;Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard</p>
<p>;;;print jeggings?</p>
<p>```(sees the donut about to</p>
<p>```kill her)</p>
<p>;;;Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!</p>

<p>But at the last second... Hopps stops it! Deep breath...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I love your hair.</p>

<p>___FRU FRU SHREW</p>
<p>;;;Aw... thank you.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and</p>
<p>smugly picks it up, ready to leave.</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON</p>
<p>;;;Come to papa...</p>

<p>Then out of nowhere, Hopps dumps the donut on his head.</p>


<p>INT. ZPD - LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>The lobby is overflowing with ANIMALS filing MISSING MAMMAL</p>
<p>REPORTS. Clawhauser is dealing with an otter, MRS. OTTERTON.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>
<p>;;;Okay, you're gonna have to be</p>
<p>;;;patient and wait in line just like</p>
<p>;;;everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?</p>
<p>```34.</p>


<p>Just then: BAM! The Weasel (in donut) rolls through the front</p>
<p>door and hits Clawhauser's desk. It settles, revealing Hopps.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I popped the weasel!</p>

<p>Behind her, Chief Bogo yells from the second floor.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;HOPPS!</p>


<p>INT. ZPD - BOGO'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Hopps sits in a big chair in front of Bogo, like a kid in the</p>
<p>principal's office. Bogo looks over a report.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;Abandoning your post, inciting a</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Sir, I don't want to be a meter</p>

<p>;;;Life isn't some cartoon musical</p>

<p>;;;I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop</p>

<p>___MRS. OTTERTON</p>
<p>;;;He's a florist. We have two</p>

<p>___MRS. OTTERTON</p>
<p>;;;Of course. Oh, thank you both so</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Okay.</p>
<p>```(deep breath)</p>
<p>;;;"Last known sighting..."</p>

<p>Hopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr.</p>
<p>Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a</p>
<p>soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Can I just borrow--</p>
<p>```(grabbing soda bottle)</p>
<p>;;;Thank you.</p>

<p>Hopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She</p>
<p>sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE.</p>

<p>;;;For what? Howting your feewings?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Felony tax evasion.</p>

<p>Nick smile drops a bit.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days</p>
<p>;;;a year... since you were 12, that's</p>
<p>;;;two decades, so times twenty...</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;...which is one million four-</p>

<p>```(presenting the forms)</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Well, it's my word against yours.</p>

<p>Hopps clicks a button on her CARROT PEN, which SPEAKS!</p>

<p>___NICK (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;"200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Actually, it's your word against</p>
<p>;;;yours. And if you want this pen,</p>
<p>;;;you're going to help me find this</p>
<p>;;;poor missing otter or the only</p>
<p>;;;place you'll be selling popsicles</p>
<p>;;;is the prison cafeteria.</p>
<p>```(dramatic smirk)</p>
<p>;;;It's called a hustle, sweetheart.</p>

<p>Nick is utterly speechless.</p>

<p>___FINNICK</p>
<p>;;;She hustled you.</p>
<p>```(rude laugh)</p>
<p>;;;She hustled you good! You're a cop</p>
<p>;;;now Nick, you're gonna need one of</p>
<p>;;;these! Have fun working with the</p>

<p>THWAP! Finnick slaps his JUNIOR OFFICER STICKER on Nick.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Start talking.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;I don't know where he is.</p>
<p>;;;I only saw where he went.</p>

<p>;;;Great, let's go.</p>
<p>```42.</p>


<p>___NICK</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Okay. You're the boss.</p>


<p>INT. THE MYSTIC SPRING OASIS - LATER</p>

<p>The Mystic Spring Oasis is new agey, full of incense, etc. A</p>
<p>meditating HIPPIE YAK sits with flies buzzing around his</p>
<p>head, matching the tone of his ohm. Hopps enters with Nick</p>
<p>and they approach the yak (still with his eyes closed).</p>

<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p>;;;Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Hi, hello.</p>

<p>The yak continues his incessant chanting.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?!</p>

<p>The yak finally shakes out of his trance and notices Hopps.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Hello! My name is--</p>

<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the</p>
<p>;;;pause button right there, `cause</p>
<p>;;;we're all good on Bunny Scout</p>
<p>;;;Cookies.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.</p>
<p>;;;I'm looking for a missing mammal,</p>
<p>;;;Emmitt Otterton. Right here--</p>
<p>```(shows photo)</p>
<p>;;;--who may have frequented this</p>
<p>;;;establishment.</p>

<p>The Yak looks at Hopps' picture. His eyes go wide, as if he's</p>
<p>about to say something really important, and then:</p>
<p>```43.</p>


<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;AH-CHOO!</p>
<p>```(flies go everywhere)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him</p>
<p>;;;in a couple weeks. But hey, you</p>
<p>;;;should talk to his yoga instructor,</p>
<p>;;;I'd be happy to take you back.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, thank you so much, I'd</p>
<p>;;;appreciate that more than you can</p>
<p>;;;imagine. It would be such a big--</p>
<p>```(scream)</p>
<p>;;;You are naked!</p>

<p>The Yak comes around the counter and he IS naked.</p>

<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;Huh? Oh for sure, we're a</p>
<p>;;;naturalist club.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be</p>
<p>;;;anything. These guys... they be</p>
<p>;;;naked.</p>

<p>Nick grins, Hopps isn't pleased.</p>

<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;Nangi's just on the other side of</p>
<p>;;;the pleasure pool.</p>

<p>The Yak opens the doors to a POOL AREA, with tons of naked</p>
<p>animals sunning themselves, playing in the pool, etc. Hopps'</p>
<p>eyes nearly pop out of her head. Nick leans in.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Does this make you uncomfortable?</p>
<p>;;;Because, if so, there's no shame in</p>
<p>;;;calling it quits.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yes there is.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Boy, that's the spirit.</p>


<p>EXT. NATURALIST CLUB - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick revels in Hopps' discomfort over the nude animals</p>
<p>everywhere. Lots of nude animals. Yax leads them, oblivious.</p>
<p>```44.</p>


<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, some mammals say the</p>
<p>;;;naturalist life is weird, but you</p>
<p>;;;know what I say is weird? Clothes</p>
<p>;;;on animals! Here we go.</p>

<p>Nangi's engaging in a string of fairly evocative yoga poses.</p>

<p>___YAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;As you can see, Nangi's an</p>
<p>;;;elephant, so she'll totally</p>
<p>;;;remember everything. Hey Nangi,</p>
<p>;;;these dudes have some questions</p>
<p>;;;about Emmitt the Otter.</p>

<p>___NANGI</p>
<p>;;;Who?</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to</p>
<p>;;;your yoga class for like 6 years?</p>

<p>___NANGI</p>
<p>;;;I have no memory of this beaver.</p>

<p>___JUDY</p>
<p>;;;He's an otter actually.</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;He was here a couple Wednesdays</p>
<p>;;;ago. `Member?</p>

<p>___NANGI</p>
<p>;;;Nope.</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-</p>
<p>;;;knit sweater vest, and new pair of</p>
<p>;;;corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley</p>
<p>;;;tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real</p>
<p>;;;tight. Remember that Nangi?</p>

<p>___NANGI</p>
<p>;;;No.</p>

<p>Nangi doesn't want to be bothered. And she's useless. Yax is</p>
<p>a gold mine, though! Hopps writes down everything he says.</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, and we both walked him out</p>
<p>;;;and he got into this big ol' white</p>
<p>;;;car with a silver trim? Needed a</p>
<p>;;;tune up. The third cylinder wasn't</p>
<p>;;;firing. `Member that, Nangi?</p>
<p>```45.</p>


<p>___NANGI</p>
<p>;;;Nope.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;You didn't happen to catch the</p>
<p>;;;license plate number, did you?</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great</p>
<p>;;;info, thank you.</p>

<p>___YAX</p>
<p>;;;Told ya Nangi has a mind like a</p>
<p>;;;steel trap. I wish I had a memory</p>
<p>;;;like an elephant.</p>


<p>EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps emerge.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Well, I had a ball. You are welcome</p>
<p>;;;for the clue. And seeing as how any</p>
<p>;;;moron can run a plate, I will take</p>
<p>;;;that pen and bid you adieu.</p>

<p>As Nick reaches to take it, Hopps realizes something and</p>
<p>leaves him hanging.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;The plate... I can't run a plate...</p>
<p>```(frustrated grunt)</p>
<p>;;;I'm not in the system yet.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Give me the pen please.</p>

<p>Hopps gets an idea...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(still withholding pen)</p>
<p>;;;What was it you said? "Any moron</p>
<p>;;;can run a plate?" Gosh... if only</p>
<p>;;;there were a moron around who were</p>
<p>;;;up to the task...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Rabbit, I did what you asked, you</p>
<p>;;;can't keep me on the hook forever.</p>
<p>```46.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Not forever. Why, I only have 36</p>
<p>;;;hours left to solve this case. So</p>
<p>;;;can you run the plate or not?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Actually, I just remembered I have</p>
<p>;;;a pal at the DMV...</p>


<p>EXT. DMV - LATER</p>

<p>They arrive at the DMV, the "Department of Mammal Vehicles."</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Flash is the fastest guy in there,</p>
<p>;;;you need something done, he's on</p>
<p>;;;it.</p>

<p>;;;I hope so, we are really fighting</p>
<p>;;;the clock and every minute counts.</p>
<p>```(suddenly stops, alarmed)</p>
<p>;;;Wait. They're all sloths?!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, every mammal working there is a... SLOTH.</p>
<p>INSERT: SLOTH EMPLOYEES taking extraordinary amounts of time</p>
<p>to do the simplest of tasks-- stapling, stamping, etc.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(faux innocence)</p>
<p>;;;What? Are you saying that because</p>
<p>;;;he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I</p>
<p>;;;thought in Zootopia anyone could be</p>

<p>Nick smiles. Hopps doesn't. They head to Flash's station.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash!</p>
<p>;;;Buddy, it's nice to see ya.</p>

<p>Flash doesn't respond. Beat.</p>

<p>;;;Here...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>

<p>They go outside. It's night.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;IT'S NIGHT?!</p>


<p>EXT. SNOWY LOT - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps reach LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE CAR SERVICE. Hopps</p>
<p>tries to open the lock.</p>

<p>There's a big gated parking lot which is chained shut... but</p>

<p>Nick considers this for a moment.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;It does. One hundred percent.</p>
<p>```(then)</p>
<p>;;;Now... since you're sans warrant, I</p>

<p>Hopps considers this and sighs, defeated.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.</p>

<p>Hopps then casually throws it over the fence behind her.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Hey!</p>

<p>Nick jumps down onto the other side, but just as he reaches</p>
<p>for the pen, Hopps is suddenly right there and snatches it.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;The thing is, you don't need a</p>
<p>;;;warrant if you have probable cause,</p>
<p>;;;and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty</p>

<p>;;;you're helping plenty. Come on.</p>

<p>Hopps cheerfully heads off. Nick watches her, not quite</p>
<p>smiling, but he's starting to respect his opponent.</p>


<p>EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Hopps wipes snow off a back bumper: LICENSE PLATE 29THD03.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;29THD03... this is it.</p>


<p>INT. REFRIGOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>They open the big door, which looks like it belongs on a</p>
<p>refrigerator. As they snoop around, Hopps uses tweezers to</p>
<p>pick up a clump of fur.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!</p>

<p>As Hopps rolls her eyes and goes back to collecting clues,</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Carrots...? If your otter was</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;No.</p>

<p>Through the fog on the floor Hopps spots a wallet.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, wait. Look.</p>

<p>They slink back into the back seat. Hopps opens up the wallet</p>
<p>to find a drivers license for Mr. Otterton.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He</p>

<p>of a residential compound. A POLAR BEAR GUARD lets them in.</p>


<p>INT. MR. BIG'S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps are shoved into a room that's right out of The</p>
<p>Godfather. A POLAR BEAR enters...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(sotto)</p>
<p>;;;Is that Mr. Big?</p>

<p>```(sotto, frustrated)</p>
<p>;;;No.</p>

<p>...and then another. The BIGGEST POLAR BEAR yet...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;That's gotta be him.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Stop talking stop talking stop</p>
<p>;;;talking--</p>

<p>The huge polar bear growls at Nick, then reveals a tiny chair</p>
<p>upon which sits... a TEENY, TINY ARCTIC SHREW... this is MR.</p>
<p>BIG. He sounds like Marlon Brando sped up to 78 rpm.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple</p>
<p>;;;misunder-</p>

<p>Mr. Big holds out a TINY FINGER for NICK to KISS HIS RING.</p>
<p>Nick painstakingly does so.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;This is a simple misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Mr. Big motions for Nick to shut up.</p>

<li> BIG</li>

<p>;;;You come here unannounced... on the</p>

<p>;;;disrespected my gram-mama who I</p>
<p>;;;buried in that skunk butt rug. I</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;No. I am a cop. And I'm on the</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Then I have only one request: say</p>

<p>The Polar Bears snatch Nick and Hopps.</p>

<p>```(then, to Hopps)</p>
<p>;;;You have done me a great service.</p>

<p>Hopps and Mr. Big kiss on the cheeks. Nick stares at them...</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>```58.</p>


<p>INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>A lavish celebration full of arctic animals dancing. We find</p>
<p>Nick and Hopps at the head table, next to Mr. Big. They all</p>
<p>eat TINY pieces of WEDDING CAKE.</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Otterton is my florist. He's like a</p>
<p>;;;part of the family. He had</p>
<p>;;;something important he wanted to</p>
<p>;;;discuss. That's why I sent that car</p>
<p>;;;to pick him up. But he never</p>
<p>;;;arrived.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Because he was attacked.</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;No... he attacked.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Otterton?</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up</p>
<p>;;;the car, scared my driver half to</p>
<p>;;;death and disappeared into the</p>
<p>;;;night.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;He's a sweet little otter.</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;My child, we may be evolved... but</p>
<p>;;;deep down we are still animals.</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps trade a worried glance. OVER THE FOLLOWING WE</p>
<p>CROSS-DISSOLVE TO NICK AND HOPPS WALKING IN THE RAINFOREST:</p>

<ol>
<li> BIG (V.O.)(CONT'D)</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;You want to find Otterton... talk</p>
<p>;;;to the driver of the car. His</p>
<p>;;;name's Manchas, lives in the</p>
<p>;;;Rainforest District. Only he can</p>
<p>;;;tell you more.</p>


<p>EXT. "RAINFOREST DISTRICT" - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps make their way across a mossy rope bridge high</p>
<p>above the forest floor. It leads to a moss-covered apartment.</p>
<p>```59.</p>


<p>EXT. "THE CANOPY" - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>At the door of the DRIVER'S APARTMENT, they ring the bell.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We</p>
<p>;;;just want to know what happened to</p>
<p>;;;Emmitt Otterton.</p>

<p>Beat. The door creaks open.</p>

<p>___MANCHAS (MUFFLED INSIDE)</p>
<p>;;;You should be asking... what</p>
<p>;;;happened to me.</p>

<p>The door opens to the chain, revealing... MANCHAS is... a</p>
<p>HUGE JAGUAR-- but he's been badly beaten up. He has a black</p>
<p>eye, and a scratches. Nick and Hopps are taken aback.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;What... happened?</p>

<p>Off Manchas's look, we</p>

<p>```CUT TO:</p>


<p>A FLASHBACK --</p>

<p>Manchas is driving when he's attacked from the back seat.</p>

<p>___MANCHAS (THROUGH DOOR GAP)</p>
<p>;;;He was an animal... down on all</p>
<p>;;;fours... he was a savage.</p>

<p>The car spins out. Emmitt growls at Manchas then runs off.</p>

<p>```BACK TO:</p>


<p>THE CANOPY --</p>

<p>___MANCHAS</p>
<p>```(haunted)</p>
<p>;;;There was no warning, he just kept</p>
<p>;;;yelling about the "night howlers."</p>
<p>;;;Over and over, "the night</p>
<p>;;;howlers..."</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps share a subtle look-- they have no idea what</p>
<p>"night howlers" are.</p>
<p>```60.</p>


<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Oh. So you know about the night</p>
<p>;;;howlers too? Good, good, good.</p>
<p>;;;Because the night howlers are</p>
<p>;;;exactly what we are here to talk</p>
<p>;;;about.</p>
<p>```(to Judy)</p>
<p>;;;Right?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yep. So, uh, you just open the door</p>
<p>;;;and tell us what you know and we</p>
<p>;;;will tell you what we know. Okay?</p>

<p>___MANCHAS</p>
<p>```(considering)</p>
<p>;;;Okay.</p>

<p>Manchas closes the door and starts to unlock a series of</p>
<p>deadbolts. Judy gives Nick an impressed look.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Clever fox.</p>

<p>There's a commotion inside, followed by a scream.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Manchas?</p>

<p>The door creaks open just an inch. Nick and Hopps seem</p>
<p>startled... Hopps slowly pushes the door open, revealing</p>
<p>Manchas in the center of the room, hunched over and grunting.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Buddy?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Are you... okay?</p>

<p>Hopps looks at Manchas.</p>

<p>RAAAGH!!! Manchas turns, right at them. His eyes are dilated,</p>
<p>he's turned savage! He's poised to pounce on Nick and Hopps.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Run. RUN!</p>

<p>The Jaguar tears after them, he's deranged, primal. Nick and</p>
<p>Hopps run! The jaguar is closing in.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;What is wrong with him?!</p>
<p>```61.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I don't know!!</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Jump!</p>

<p>They jump off the bridge to a lower branch. They duck into a</p>
<p>hollow log and Manchas follows them.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(to Nick)</p>
<p>;;;Head down!</p>

<p>Hopps frantically picks up her police radio.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Officer Hopps to dispatch!</p>


<p>INT. POLICE STATION - DISPATCH - SAME</p>

<p>We find Clawhauser showing a handcuffed PERP a video on his</p>
<p>phone of pop star Gazelle singing and dancing. A RED LIGHT</p>
<p>blinks on the desk phone, but Clawhauser ignores it.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER</p>

<p>;;;Hold on a second--</p>

<p>Clawhauser clicks the speaker button and--</p>

<p>RAAGH! Manchas takes a swipe at Nick.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a</p>
<p>;;;10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and</p>
<p>;;;Tu-junja!</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;It's Tujunga!</p>

<p>As they emerge from the log, Hopps slips, dropping her radio.</p>

<p>___CLAWHAUSER (ON RADIO)</p>
<p>;;;Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps?</p>
<p>;;;HOPPS?!</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps run, sliding around a corner. Ahead is a</p>
<p>gondola station.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;There! Head to the skytrams!</p>

<p>They run to the gondolas. Hopps darts out of Manchas' way,</p>
<p>but slips and is headed off the platform when she manages to</p>
<p>grab on-- dangling from the edge. Nick searches for her...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Get in! Carrots? Carrots!</p>

<p>He tries to hold on to the gondola for Hopps, who is</p>
<p>struggling to pull herself back onto the platform.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Go!</p>

<p>As the gondola pulls away, Nick tries to stop it to no avail.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;No, no, no!</p>

<p>Nick backs up... the jaguar stalks him.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Buddy, one predator to another--___*</p>

<p>The jaguar charges, but before it gets Nick-- clank! It's       *</p>
<p>yanked back in place. We see a HANDCUFF on its back paw,</p>
<p>attached to a metal post. Hopps cuffed him!</p>
<p>```63.</p>


<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Now, I can tell you're a little</p>
<p>;;;tense, so I'm just gonna give you a</p>
<p>;;;little personal space--</p>

<p>The jaguar thrashes, knocking Nick and Hopps over the edge.</p>
<p>Hopps barely grabs a vine, but struggles to hold Nick in the</p>
<p>other hand. As Manchas growls at them from above, Nick looks</p>
<p>at the abyss below. Hopps looks around, her mind racing.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let</p>
<p>;;;go!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I'm gonna let go!</p>

<p>;;;No, you what? No, I said-- listen--</p>
<p>;;;noooo!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;One, two--</p>

<p>Hopps lets go, swinging them over to a netting of vines, kind</p>
<p>of on top of each other. They can't believe they're alive.</p>
<p>They look at each other, stunned, relieved...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Carrots. You saved my life.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Well. That's what we do at the</p>
<p>;;;ZP...</p>
<p>```(the branch snaps)</p>
<p>;;;Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps plummet. They are about to hit the ground, but</p>
<p>a vine attached to their legs stops them right before impact.</p>

<p>Woo! A convoy of police arrive, screeching in front of them.</p>
<p>Out steps... Bogo. Hopps smiles, the cavalry has arrived.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;Well, this should be good.</p>


<p>MOMENTS LATER --</p>

<p>Hopps leads the cops up to the canopy, full of confidence.</p>

<p>;;;I thought this was just a missing</p>

<p>There is no sign of him... or his handcuffs. It's like it</p>

<p>___NICK (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Uh, no.</p>

<p>Bogo stops, and glares at Nick.</p>

<p>___BOGO</p>
<p>;;;What did you say, fox?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Sorry, what I said was, "no." She</p>

<p>;;;no wonder she needed to get help</p>

<p>Hopps looks at Nick, stunned he's sticking up for her.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Here's the thing Chief, you gave</p>
<p>;;;her the 48 hours, so technically we</p>
<p>;;;still have 10 left to find our Mr.</p>
<p>;;;Otterton... and that's exactly what</p>
<p>;;;we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse</p>
<p>;;;us... we have a very big lead to</p>

<p>___MEAN KID ANIMAL</p>
<p>;;;If you thought we would ever trust</p>
<p>;;;a fox without a muzzle, you're even</p>
<p>;;;dumber than you look.</p>

<p>Nick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in</p>
<p>fright. As they laugh, he races out the door.</p>

<p>___MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Aw, is he gonna cry?</p>

<p>Once out sight, Nick panics as he struggles to remove the</p>
<p>muzzle. It won't come off. Finally-- painfully-- he pulls it</p>
<p>off and throws it to the ground. He collapses, weeping.</p>


<p>THE GONDOLA --</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;I learned two things that day. One,</p>
<p>;;;I was never gonna let anyone see</p>
<p>;;;that they got to me.</p>

<p>Hopps looks at Nick, who avoids eye contact.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;...And two?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;If the world's only gonna see a fox</p>
<p>;;;as shifty and untrustworthy,</p>
<p>;;;there's no point in trying to be</p>
<p>;;;anything else.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Nick, you are so much more than</p>
<p>;;;that...</p>

<p>Hopps touches Nick's arm as the gondola pierces the clouds.</p>
<p>The city at dawn comes into view. It's gotten too real for</p>
<p>Nick. He abruptly changes the subject.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Boy, look at that traffic down</p>
<p>;;;there.</p>
<p>```(putting on radio voice)</p>
<p>;;;How about we go out to Chuck in</p>
<p>;;;Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(lightbulb moment!)</p>
<p>;;;The Jam Cams...!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;The traffic cams would have caught</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Bingo!</p>

<p>Hopps gives him a chuck on the arm, impressed.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Pretty sneaky, Slick.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;However. If you didn't have access</p>

<p>;;;No... But I have a friend at City</p>

<p>INT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT MORNING</p>

<p>We find BELLWETHER trying to balance a stack of binders while</p>
<p>struggling to keep pace with Mayor Lionheart, who is walking</p>
<p>quickly in front of her.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Sir? If we could just review these</p>
<p>;;;very important--</p>
<p>```(almost drops binders)</p>
<p>;;;Sir?</p>

<p>She almost steps on a LITTLE MOUSE LADY.</p>
<p>```70.</p>


<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!</p>

<p>___LIONHEART</p>
<p>;;;Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just</p>
<p>;;;take care of it!</p>
<p>```(setting another binder</p>
<p>```atop her stack)</p>
<p>;;;Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm</p>
<p>;;;going out.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;No, no! But, sir, you do have a</p>
<p>;;;meeting with Herds and Grazing...</p>
<p>;;;sir, if I could just--</p>

<p>He continues through a door. Bellwether tries to follow, but</p>
<p>the door shuts on her, spilling the binders to the floor.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, mutton chops.</p>

<p>As Bellwether picks up her mess, Hopps and Nick appear.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need</p>
<p>;;;your help.</p>


<p>INT. BELLWETHER'S OFFICE - LATER</p>

<p>We're in Bellwether's cramped little office. Nick and Hopps</p>
<p>hover over her while she sits at her computer.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;We just need to get into the</p>
<p>;;;traffic cam database.</p>

<p>Nick subtly touches Bellwether's wool puff.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(mouths, to Hopps)</p>
<p>;;;So fluffy!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Hey!</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Sheep never let me this close.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;You can't just touch a sheep's</p>
<p>;;;wool...</p>
<p>```71.</p>


<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;It's like cotton candy.</p>
<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Stop it!</p>

<p>Judy swats Nick, but accidentally hits Bellwether's puff.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Where to?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Rainforest District, Vine and</p>
<p>;;;Tujunga.</p>

<p>ANGLE ON the computer screen.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;There! Traffic cams for the whole</p>
<p>;;;city. This is so exciting,</p>
<p>;;;actually. Well, you know, I never</p>
<p>;;;get to do anything this important.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;But you're the Assistant Mayor of</p>
<p>;;;Zootopia.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Oh, I'm more of a glorified</p>
<p>;;;secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart</p>
<p>;;;just wanted the sheep vote...</p>
<p>```(then, cheerily)</p>
<p>;;;But he did give me that nice mug.</p>

<p>She motions to a mug that reads World's Greatest Dad</p>
<p>Assistant Mayor.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Feels good to be appreciated.</p>

<p>___LIONHEART (INTERCOM)</p>
<p>;;;Smellwether?!</p>

<p>Bellwether cringes.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;That's a fun little name he likes</p>
<p>;;;to use. I called him Lionfart once.</p>
<p>;;;He did not care for that, let me</p>
<p>;;;tell you. It was not a good day for</p>
<p>;;;me.</p>
<p>```(pressing intercom button)</p>
<p>;;;Yes, sir?</p>

<p>___LIONHEART (INTERCOM)</p>
<p>;;;I thought you were going to cancel</p>
<p>;;;my afternoon?!</p>
<p>```72.</p>


<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Oh, dear. I better go --</p>
<p>```(to Hopps, while leaving)</p>
<p>;;;Let me know what you find. It was</p>
<p>;;;really nice for me to be--</p>

<p>___LIONHEART (INTERCOM)</p>
<p>;;;While we're young, Smellwether!</p>

<p>Bellwether finally opens her big heavy door and leaves.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;You think when she goes to sleep</p>
<p>;;;she counts herself?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Shush. Okay, traffic cams...</p>
<p>```(looking at computer)</p>
<p>;;;Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We</p>
<p>can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and</p>
<p>some WOLVES hop out.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Who are these guys?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Timberwolves. Look at these</p>
<p>;;;dumdums.</p>

<p>The Wolves suddenly capture the jaguar with a net. Judy</p>
<p>GASPS, shocked. Nick is unfazed.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna</p>
<p>;;;howl.</p>

<p>The wolves howl...</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;And there it is. What is it with</p>
<p>;;;wolves and the howling? It's like--</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(light-bulb moment)</p>
<p>;;;Howlers! Night howlers! That's what</p>
<p>;;;Manchas was afraid of... wolves!</p>
<p>;;;The wolves are the night howlers.</p>
<p>;;;If they took Manchas...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;...I bet they took Otterton too.</p>
<p>```73.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;All we gotta do is find out where</p>
<p>;;;they went.</p>

<p>She clicks the monitor... but as the wolves drive off, they</p>
<p>disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Wait. Where'd they go?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;You know, if I wanted to avoid</p>
<p>;;;surveillance because I was doing</p>
<p>;;;something illegal-- which I never</p>
<p>;;;have-- I would use the maintenance</p>
<p>;;;tunnel 6B... which would put them</p>
<p>;;;out...</p>

<p>He clicks on another camera. Nothing... then... the wolves</p>
<p>emerge in the van.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;...right there.</p>

<p>Hopps looks at Nick, impressed.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Well, look at you, Junior</p>
<p>;;;Detective. You know, I think you'd</p>
<p>;;;actually make a pretty good cop.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;How dare you.</p>

<p>Hopps goes back to clicking... we track the wolves through</p>
<p>alleys and back roads.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Acacia alley... Ficus underpass...</p>
<p>;;;South Canyon...</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;They're heading out of town...</p>
<p>;;;Where does that road go?</p>


<p>EXT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - GOLDEN HOUR</p>

<p>The imposing CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM sits on the edge of a</p>
<p>waterfall. Nick and Hopps, hidden on the side of the road,</p>
<p>spy from a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps sneak up to the guard gate, where TWO WOLVES</p>
<p>are stationed.</p>
<p>```74.</p>


<p>Using elaborate hand signals, Nick motions he's going to</p>
<p>sneak past first. He gets around the gate, but as he gets</p>
<p>close... a wolf sniffs the air... he's onto him.</p>

<p>Nick reaches around and grabs a piece of wood to use as a</p>
<p>weapon. The wolf moves toward Nick... but before he reaches</p>
<p>him... Ooooooooooo!</p>

<p>A distant howl grabs his attention. It's Hopps, cupping her</p>
<p>mouth to make the howl sound distant. The wolf hears it and</p>
<p>can't help but howl as well. Another guard approaches.</p>

<p>___WOLF GUARD</p>
<p>;;;Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a</p>
<p>;;;howl.</p>

<p>___GARY THE WOLF GUARD</p>
<p>;;;I didn't start it.</p>
<p>```(more howling off-screen)</p>
<p>;;;Oooooooo!</p>

<p>___WOLF GUARD</p>
<p>;;;Oooooooooo!</p>

<p>More wolves start to howl. Nick looks at Hopps, impressed.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Come on!</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps use the distraction to jump the fence and</p>
<p>sneak into the complex.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;You are a clever bunny.</p>

<p>Above, they notice a drainage pipe leading into the building.</p>


<p>INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - LARGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps emerge from the drain pipe into the creepy</p>
<p>asylum. They're in a large, cavernous room, full of old</p>
<p>MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. It's like a combination of an old hospital</p>
<p>and a turn-of-the-century zoo.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;It looks like this was a hospital.</p>

<p>Judy shines her light down a corridor, at the end of which is</p>
<p>a metal door with a blue light shining within. Nick nears the</p>
<p>door, about to open it... the tension builds and then...</p>
<p>```75.</p>


<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(turns to Hopps)</p>
<p>;;;You know, after you, you're the</p>
<p>;;;cop.</p>


<p>INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - MEDICAL WARD - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>Hopps cautiously pushes the door open to reveal: a room with</p>
<p>modern medical equipment. Nick pops up behind her.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Okay. All clear.</p>

<p>Hopps rolls her eyes and cautiously enters and looks around.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;All this equipment is brand new...</p>

<p>___NICK (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Carrots...?</p>

<p>Nick points to the ground, which is scuffed with CLAW MARKS.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Claw marks...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I</p>
<p>;;;mean, what kind of--</p>

<p>RAAGH! A SAVAGE TIGER emerges behind the glass of a nearby</p>
<p>cage, startling Nick and sending him running to Hopps.</p>

<p>Hopps swivels her flashlight to reveal: dozens of reflective</p>
<p>eyes. Nick and Hopps make their way down a long corridor of</p>
<p>cages, looking for the jaguar.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Manchas.</p>

<p>He's still feral, on all fours and pacing in a cell. They</p>
<p>continue on, passing three, four, five, cages until finally,</p>
<p>in the last cage: a FERAL OTTER. It's EMMITT OTTERTON.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;It's him. We found our otter.</p>
<p>```(to the otter, gently)</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer</p>
<p>;;;Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to</p>
<p>;;;find you. We're gonna get you out</p>
<p>;;;of here now.</p>

<p>Otterton screeches at her and lunges toward the glass.</p>
<p>```76.</p>


<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Or not. Guess he's in no rush to</p>
<p>;;;get home to the Missus.</p>

<p>Hopps looks back down the corridor of cells, counting.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including</p>
<p>;;;Manchas it's 14...</p>
<p>```(lightbulb)</p>
<p>;;;Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing</p>
<p>;;;Mammal files... They're all here.</p>
<p>;;;All the missing mammals are right</p>
<p>;;;here.</p>

<p>Before she can respond-- CLICK! A door starts to open, Nick</p>
<p>and Hopps retreat, stuck next to a DARK CELL.</p>

<p>___LIONHEART (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Enough! I don't want excuses,</p>
<p>;;;Doctor, I want answers.</p>

<p>Reveal: Mayor Lionheart berating the BADGER DOCTOR by his</p>
<p>side. He looks serious, intense, tired.</p>

<p>___BADGER DOCTOR</p>
<p>;;;Mayor Lionheart, please, we're</p>
<p>;;;doing everything we can.</p>

<p>Hopps whips out her phone, starts recording.</p>

<p>___LIONHEART</p>
<p>;;;Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a</p>
<p>;;;half animals here who've gone off</p>
<p>;;;the rails crazy-- and you can't</p>
<p>;;;tell me why. Now, I'd call that</p>
<p>;;;awfully far from doing everything.</p>

<p>___BADGER DOCTOR</p>
<p>;;;Sir, it may be time to consider</p>
<p>;;;their biology.</p>

<p>___LIONHEART</p>
<p>;;;What? What do you mean biology?</p>

<p>___BADGER DOCTOR</p>
<p>;;;The only animals going savage are</p>
<p>;;;predators. We cannot keep it a</p>
<p>;;;secret. We need to come forward.</p>
<p>```77.</p>


<p>___LIONHEART</p>
<p>;;;Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public.</p>
<p>;;;And how do you think they're gonna</p>
<p>;;;feel about their mayor, who is a</p>
<p>;;;lion?! I'll be ruined!</p>

<p>___BADGER DOCTOR</p>
<p>;;;Well, what does Chief Bogo say?</p>

<p>___LIONHEART</p>
<p>;;;Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are</p>
<p>;;;going to keep it that way.</p>

<p>Beep-beep-beep-- Hopps' parents call in. She frantically</p>
<p>tries to silence her phone.</p>

<p>___LIONHEART (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Someone's here!</p>

<p>___BADGER DOCTOR</p>
<p>;;;Sir, you need to go, now!</p>
<p>```(calls out)</p>
<p>;;;Security! Sweep the area!</p>

<p>AN ALARM SOUNDS. The door to the cell Hopps and Nick are in</p>
<p>triggers shut. They notice WOLVES approaching.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Great! We're dead. We're dead.</p>
<p>;;;That's it. I'm dead. You're dead.</p>
<p>;;;Everybody's dead.</p>

<p>This gives Hopps an idea. She looks at the HUGE TOILET.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Can you swim?</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim.</p>
<p>;;;Why?</p>

<p>The Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see</p>
<p>the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain.</p>

<p>Hopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the</p>
<p>sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They</p>
<p>land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks</p>
<p>desperately for Judy.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!</p>

<p>She emerges, gasping for breath, holding up the bagged phone.</p>
<p>```78.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;We gotta tell Bogo!</p>

<p>EXT. ASYLUM - DAY</p>

<p>Cop cars and helicopters surround the asylum. Hopps, flanked</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Yes. What I mean is, thousands of</p>

<p>;;;Probably best if you don't have a</p>

<p>As he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON (PRE-LAP)</p>
<p>;;;A ram named Doug. We got a drop</p>

<p>EXT. SUBWAY STATION - A LITTLE LATER</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station.</p>

<p>___DUKE WEASELTON (V.O.)</p>
<p>;;;...Just watch it. Doug is the</p>
<p>;;;opposite of friendly. He's</p>
<p>;;;unfriendly...</p>

<p>They arrive at the entrance and quickly sneak under the gate.</p>


<p>INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>They emerge on a platform and spot an abandoned subway car.</p>
<p>```96.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Come on!</p>

<p>As they sneak up to it... Hopps pulls open the window and</p>
<p>looks inside the car. They both jump into...</p>


<p>INT. THE GREENHOUSE CAR - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>They both see the rows of night howlers.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;The weasel wasn't lying.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, looks like old Doug's</p>
<p>;;;cornered the market on night</p>
<p>;;;howlers...</p>

<p>Click! A door opens off screen! They quickly hide under a</p>
<p>desk as a TOUGH SHEEP LABWORKER enters.</p>

<p>He goes through the process of harvesting the pollen,</p>
<p>eventually producing a small, blue paint ball pellet of night</p>
<p>howler toxin. Nick and Hopps watch it all.</p>

<p>The Sheep's phone RINGS.</p>

<p>___DOUG</p>
<p>```(into phone)</p>
<p>;;;You got Doug here. What's the mark?</p>
<p>;;;Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.</p>

<p>The Sheep loads a gun, cocks it. We see a MAP with pictures</p>
<p>of a various animal targets.</p>

<p>___DOUG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(into phone)</p>
<p>;;;Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.</p>
<p>;;;I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny</p>
<p>;;;little otter through the open</p>
<p>;;;window of a moving car.</p>

<p>Hearing this, the pieces of the puzzle start falling into</p>
<p>place for Hopps. She looks up at the picture of Otterton-- we</p>
<p>FLASHBACK to see Doug hitting him with a serum pellet. Then</p>
<p>Hopps looks at Manchas's picture-- we FLASHBACK to that.</p>

<p>___DOUG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(into phone)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done.</p>
<p>;;;Or you'll see it on the news. Ya</p>

<p>BAM, BAM, BAM! The goons have returned.</p>

<p>___WOOLTER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Hey Doug, open up! We've got your</p>
<p>;;;latte.</p>

<p>___DOUG</p>

<p>;;;Alright, Woolter and Jesse are</p>
<p>;;;back, so I'm leaving now.</p>
<p>```(then)</p>
<p>;;;Out.</p>

<p>Hopps looks around, what is she going to do. As Doug goes to</p>
<p>the door to unlock it, Hopps creeps out of their hiding spot.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get</p>
<p>;;;back here! What are you doing?!</p>
<p>;;;He's gonna see you! What are you</p>

<p>;;;thinking, stop thinking it.</p>
<p>;;;Carrots! Carrots!</p>

<p>___DOUG</p>
<p>;;;It better have the extra foam this</p>
<p>;;;time--</p>

<p>BAM! Hopps kicks Woolter in the back, knocking him into the</p>
<p>other two Thugs. Hopps locks the door.</p>

<p>___WOOLTER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Hey, open up!</p>

<p>The Thugs start banging on the doors.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;What are you doing?! You just</p>
<p>;;;trapped us in here!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;We need to get this evidence to the</p>

<p>Nick picks up the case.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;No. All of it!</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Wait, what?</p>
<p>```98.</p>


<p>Hopps rushes to the control room, tries to start the engine.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Great, you're a conductor now? Hey,</p>
<p>;;;listen-- It would take a miracle to</p>
<p>;;;get this rust-bucket going.</p>

<p>The train starts moving.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Well... Hallelujah!</p>


<p>INT. TRAIN TRACKS - SAME</p>

<p>;;;We kinda got a situation at the</p>
<p>;;;lab...</p>

<p>;;;Oh! It just got worse!</p>

<p>Doug and his minions race after the train.</p>

<p>```BACK TO:</p>


<p>INT. SUBWAY CAR - SAME</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Mission accomplished. Would it be</p>
<p>;;;premature for me to do a little</p>
<p>;;;victory toot-toot?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;All right. One toot-toot.</p>

<p>Nick blows the train whistle.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Well, I can cross that off the</p>
<p>;;;bucket list.</p>

<p>Things are looking up, when:</p>

<p>BAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door</p>
<p>closed right before Woolter gets to them.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I may have to rescind that victory</p>
<p>;;;toot-toot.</p>
<p>```99.</p>


<p>Noise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM!</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Maybe that's just hail?</p>

<p>Uh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but</p>
<p>flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Back off!</p>

<p>Nick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging</p>
<p>toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives,</p>
<p>Nick pulls the door open.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Incoming!</p>

<p>Woolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him</p>
<p>onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs</p>
<p>onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car</p>
<p>hurtles down the tunnel.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Carrots?!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>```(to Nick)</p>
<p>;;;Don't stop! Keep going!</p>

<p>```(about to get run over)</p>
<p>;;;No! No! Please stop!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Do not stop this car!</p>

<p>Jesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top</p>
<p>of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above</p>
<p>ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward</p>
<p>them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Speed up, Nick! Speed up!</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(staving off Woolter)</p>
<p>;;;There's another train coming!</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Trust me! SPEED! UP!</p>

<p>Woolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but</p>
<p>he can't. He struggles like crazy.</p>
<p>```100.</p>


<p>___WOOLTER</p>
<p>;;;Stop the train! Hey!</p>

<p>Then, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him:</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Hey. Need some help?</p>

<p>Hopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on</p>
<p>the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible</p>
<p>second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the</p>
<p>oncoming car.</p>

<p>Except...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!</p>
<p>;;;Hold on!</p>

<p>The train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers</p>
<p>catch fire.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I think this is our stop!</p>

<p>Hopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway</p>
<p>platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Okay... Maybe some of the evidence</p>
<p>;;;survived.</p>

<p>A second loud EXPLOSION. The train is destroyed.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Everything is gone. We've lost it</p>
<p>;;;all.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(shaking head)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah. Oh, except for this.</p>

<p>Nick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, Nick! Yes!</p>

<p>Judy SMACKS him on the arm. Hard. Nick grimaces.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.</p>

<p>INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT</p>

<p>Nick and Hopps race through the empty museum. The ZPD</p>
<p>entrance is just ahead.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oh! There it is!</p>

<p>They're going to make it.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Judy! Judy!</p>

<p>Judy and Nick stop and turn. There's Bellwether, standing</p>
<p>behind them with TWO RAM COPS.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Mayor Bellwether!</p>
<p>```(out of breath, rapidly)</p>
<p>;;;We found out what's happening.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;You know what... I think Nick and I</p>
<p>;;;will just take this to the ZPD...</p>

<p>Hopps turns toward the ZPD. Uh oh. One of Bellwether's RAMS</p>
<p>is blocking the way. Nick just now gets what's going on.</p>

<p>___HOPPS (CONT'D) & NICK</p>
<p>;;;Run!</p>
<p>```102.</p>


<p>They take off-- away from the ZPD-- down a dark corridor.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Get them!</p>

<p>Hopps looks over her shoulder as she runs-- not seeing a</p>
<p>sharp WOOLY MAMMOTH TUSK sticking out. It slashes her leg,</p>
<p>knocking her off her feet.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Ach!</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Ah Carrots!</p>

<p>Nick goes to her. Her leg is bleeding badly.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I got ya, come here, come here.</p>

<p>He carries her behind a pillar.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Okay, now just relax.</p>

<p>Nick digs a handkerchief from his pocket. A few BLUEBERRIES</p>
<p>fall out with it.</p>

<p>___NICK (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Whoops... Blueberry?</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Pass.</p>

<p>;;;That's not happening.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;I can't walk.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Just, we'll think of something.</p>

<p>Bellwether finally appears, flanked by the Rams.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;We're on the same team, Judy!</p>
<p>```103.</p>


<p>WITH BELLWETHER &amp; THUGS --</p>

<p>Bellwether talks as they look for Hopps and Nick...</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Underestimated. Under-appreciated.</p>
<p>;;;Aren't you sick of it? Predators.</p>
<p>;;;They may be strong and loud, but</p>
<p>;;;prey out-number predators 10 to</p>
<p>;;;one.</p>

<p>Bellwether sees a SHADOW-- RABBIT EARS. She gestures to the</p>
<p>RAMS-- there they are.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Think of it-- 90 percent of the</p>
<p>;;;population, united against a common</p>
<p>;;;enemy. We'll be unstoppable.</p>

<p>The Rams are about to pounce on Hopps and Nick... only to</p>
<p>find the shadow is coming from a MUMMIFIED JACKALOPE being</p>
<p>illuminated by a shop light.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(to Goons)</p>
<p>;;;Over there!</p>

<p>Hopps and Nick are making a run for it. They're going to make</p>
<p>it to the ZPD! When suddenly...</p>

<p>BAM! A RAM tackles them both, knocking the case out of Nick's</p>
<p>paws. Both of them fall into a sunken diorama. Bellwether,</p>
<p>with case in hand, looks over the edge.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Well, you should have stayed on the</p>
<p>;;;carrot farm, huh? It really is too</p>
<p>;;;bad; I really did like you.</p>

<p>;;;What are you going to do? Kill me?</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;No! Of course not... he is.</p>

<p>Bellwether takes the dart gun out of the case, aims at Nick</p>
<p>and... THWICK! She darts him.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;No! Nick?!</p>

<p>Nick starts to shake and crouch. Bellwether dials her phone.</p>
<p>```104.</p>


<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Yes, police! There's a savage fox</p>
<p>;;;in the natural history museum.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER</p>
<p>;;;Oh, but he can't help it, can he?</p>
<p>;;;Since preds are just biologically</p>
<p>;;;predisposed to be savages.</p>

<p>Nick stalks Hopps, who tries to limp away.</p>

<p>___BELLWETHER (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero</p>
<p>;;;Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."</p>

<p>;;;Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p>;;;Assignments! Officers Grizzoli,</p>
<p>;;;Fangmeyer, Delgato: Tundratown</p>
<p>;;;Swat. Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard:</p>
<p>;;;Undercover. Hopps, Wilde...</p>
<p>```(beat of anticipation)</p>
<p>;;;Parking duty. Dismissed.</p>

<p>;;;Just kidding! We have reports of a</p>

<p>INT. / EXT. COP CAR (DRIVING SHOTS) - DAY</p>

<p>Hopps drives. Nick rides shotgun, eating a Pawpsickle.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;So are all rabbits bad drivers or</p>
<p>;;;is it just you?</p>

<p>She slams on the brakes. He lurches forward, accidentally</p>
<p>jamming the Pawpsickle into his face.</p>
<p>```109.</p>


<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Oops. Sorry.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>```(as he wipes off his face)</p>
<p>;;;Sly bunny.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Dumb fox.</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;You know you love me.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>They smile wide. They're stopped at a red light, when</p>
<p>suddenly-- a TRICKED OUT RED SPORTS CAR blasts through the</p>
<p>light! They look at each other and smile even wider.</p>

<p>Hopps stomps on the gas. Nick hits the siren. The patrol car</p>
<p>takes off...</p>


<p>EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>The fleeing sports car comes to a screeching halt. ANGLE ON</p>
<p>the license plate: FST NML. Hopps and Nick exit their car and</p>
<p>approach the driver.</p>

<p>___HOPPS</p>
<p>;;;Sir, you were going 115 miles per</p>
<p>;;;hour. I hope you have a good</p>
<p>;;;explanation.</p>

<p>But when they get to the driver's window...</p>

<p>___NICK</p>
<p>;;;Flash? Flash? Hundred yard dash?!</p>

<p>Yep. It's Flash the sloth.</p>

<p>___FLASH</p>
<p>```(several beats)</p>
<p>;;;Nick.</p>
