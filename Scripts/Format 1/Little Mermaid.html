<dt><strong>Scuttle</strong>:</dt>

And now, look at me - wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate. Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough. Flotsam! Jetsam! I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.

<dt><strong>Triton</strong>:</dt>

<dt><strong>Ariel</strong>:</dt>

<dt><strong>Triton</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the surface again. Is that clear?&nbsp;<em>[Ariel leaves, crying.]</em></dd>
<dt><strong>Sebastian</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Hm! Teenagers. . . . They think they know everything. You give them an inch, they swim all over you.</dd>
<dt><strong>Triton</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?</dd>
<dt><strong>Sebastian</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Definitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss. None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense. No, sir - I'd keep her under tight control.</dd>
<dt><strong>Triton</strong>:</dt>
<dd>You're absolutely right, Sebastian.</dd>
<dt><strong>Sebastian</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Of course.</dd>
<dt><strong>Triton</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Ariel needs constant supervision.</dd>
<dt><strong>Sebastian</strong>:</dt>

<dt><strong>Ursula</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Come in. Come in, my child. We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude. One MIGHT question your upbringing. . . . Now, then. You're here because you have a thing for this human. This, er, prince fellow. Not that I blame you - he is quite a catch, isn't he? Well, angel fish, the solution to your problem is simple. The only way to get what you want - is to become a human yourself.</dd>
<dt><strong>Ariel</strong>:</dt>
<dd>Can you DO that?</dd>
<dt><strong>Ursula</strong>:</dt>
<dd>My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To help unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.&nbsp;<br /><em>[singing]</em><br />I admit that in the past I've been a nasty<br />They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch<br />But you'll find that nowadays<br />I've mended all my ways<br />Repented, seen the light and made a switch<br />True? Yes<br />
<p>And I fortunately know a little magic<br />It's a talent that I always have possessed<br />And here lately, please don't laugh<br />I use it on behalf<br />Of the miserable, lonely and depressed<br /><em>[Pathetic]</em></p>
<p>Poor unfortunate souls<br />In pain<br />In need<br />This one longing to be thinner<br />That one wants to get the girl<br />And do I help them?<br />Yes, indeed<br />Those poor unfortunate souls<br />So sad<br />So true<br />They come flocking to my cauldron<br />Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"<br />And I help them?<br />Yes, I do</p>
<p>Now it's happened once or twice<br />Someone couldn't pay the price<br />And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals<br />Yes, I've had the odd complaint<br />But on the whole I've been a saint<br />To those poor unfortunate souls</p>
<p>Now, here's the deal. I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days. Got that? Three days. Now listen, this is important. Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol' princey to fall in love with you. That is, he's got to kiss you. Not just any kiss - the kiss of true love. If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.</p>
