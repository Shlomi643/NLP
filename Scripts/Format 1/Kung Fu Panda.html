<p>;;;it.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across</p>
<p>```the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>;;;Finally!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,</p>
<p>```sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and</p>
<p>```strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to</p>
<p>```run.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace</p>
<p>```steps.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends</p>
<p>```him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```78.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and</p>
<p>```smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes</p>
<p>```right back at Po.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;That scroll is mine!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the</p>
<p>```scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down</p>
<p>```stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down</p>
<p>```on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the</p>
<p>```scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po</p>
<p>```snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies</p>
<p>```towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,</p>
<p>```but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart</p>
<p>```which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the</p>
<p>```noodle.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees</p>
<p>```and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the</p>
<p>```street.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array</p>
<p>```of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around</p>
<p>```to hide the scroll.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;Lightning!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po</p>
<p>```uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes</p>
<p>```out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll</p>
<p>```rolls down the steps towards the river.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases</p>
<p>```down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the</p>
<p>```fireworks-filled sky.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The</p>
<p>```scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an</p>
<p>```ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who</p>
<p>```sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-</p>
<p>```vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is</p>
<p>```shocked.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>;;;The scroll has given him power.</p>
<p>```(then)</p>
<p>;;;NOOO0!!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting</p>
<p>```shockwave collapses the building.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```79.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach</p>
<p>```the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and</p>
<p>```unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the</p>
<p>```ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating</p>
<p>```punch.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the</p>
<p>```impact crater.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(out of breath)</p>
<p>;;;Finally... oh yes... the power of</p>
<p>;;;the Dragon Scroll... is mine!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;It's NOTHING!!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po stirs.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;It's okay. I didn't get it the</p>
<p>;;;first time either.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>```(disbelief)</p>
<p>;;;What?</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po gets to his feet.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;There is no secret ingredient. It's</p>
<p>;;;just you.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>;;;RRRAAAH!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;AAAAGGGHH!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!</p>
<p>;;;Don't! Don't!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he</p>
<p>```delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```80.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms</p>
<p>```come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing</p>
<p>```back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what</p>
<p>```he just did.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po</p>
<p>```strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even</p>
<p>```getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai</p>
<p>```Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai</p>
<p>```Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po</p>
<p>```prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!</p>
<p>```He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until</p>
<p>```finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the</p>
<p>```ground.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>```(heavy breathing)</p>
<p>;;;You... can't defeat me. You're just</p>
<p>;;;a big, fat panda!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the</p>
<p>;;;big, fat panda.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>

<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;Oh, you know this hold?</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___TAI LUNG</p>
<p>;;;You're bluffing. You're bluffing!</p>
<p>;;;Shifu didn't teach you that.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;Nope. I figured it out.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```He flexes his pinky...</p>
<p>```</p>

<p>```EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the</p>
<p>```Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.</p>

<p>```DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist</p>
<p>```looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___KG SHAW</p>
<p>;;;Look! The Dragon Warrior.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and</p>
<p>```his scarf is a torn apron.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the</p>
<p>```crowd.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO'S DAD</p>
<p>;;;That's my boy. That big, lovely</p>
<p>;;;kung fu warrior is my son!</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the</p>
<p>```ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest</p>
<p>```of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.</p>

<p>```INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER</p>

<p>```Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still</p>
<p>```lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his</p>

<p>```</p>
<p>___PO</p>
<p>;;;Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>```Shifu weakly opens his eyes.</p>
