          A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
<strong>                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
</strong>                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.

</strong>                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.

<strong>          INT. BAR
</strong>          
          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
<strong>                                GANG BOSS

                     Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
          
          The Boss punches the table.
          
<strong>                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
</strong>                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.

<strong>                     SHASHABOOEY!
</strong>          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
<strong>                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
</strong>                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.

          The gang members blindly flail about.

          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.

          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
<strong>                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
</strong>                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.

                    feared... and so loved.

</strong>                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.
          
<strong>                                MONKEY

<strong>                                 WARRIOR
</strong>                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.
          
<strong>                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
</strong>                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
          
<strong>                                MONKEY

<strong>          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
</strong>          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
<strong>                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
</strong>                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.

</strong>                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
<strong>                              PO (CONT'D)

                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
<strong>                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
</strong>                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!

</strong>                    Coming!
          
          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
<strong>          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</strong>          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Sorry, Dad.

</strong>                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.

          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.

                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.

          He throws his arms around Po.

          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle

          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
<strong>          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
</strong>          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
<strong>                                                                      8.

                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
<strong>                              ZENG
</strong>                    Master Shifu!

<strong>                              ZENG
</strong>                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
<strong>          INT. HALLWAY
</strong>          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
<strong>          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
</strong>          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
<strong>                                                                     9.
</strong>          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    You were saying?

</strong>                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
<strong>          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
</strong>          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
<strong>          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
</strong>          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their
                    weapons. Double everything! Tai
                    Lung does not leave that prison!
          
<strong>                              ZENG
</strong>                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
<strong>                                                                   10.

<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.

<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    I don't know.

          Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between
          tables.

          A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a

          is his heroic moment.

          stairs.

          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.

          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.

          Po struggles to peek through the window.

          A palanquin is carried past Shifu.

</strong>                    Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
          
          Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He
          is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
          
          Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
          
          Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
          carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
          thronging crowd to get to Oogway.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
                    panda can't possibly be the answer
                    to... our problem. You were about
                    to point at Tigress. That thing
                    fell in front of her. That was just
                    an accident!
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    There are no accidents.
          
          Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
          
          The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
          under Po.
          
          Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
          
          A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
          and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
          Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
          
          Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
          
<strong>                              TIGRESS

          Shifu spins around.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    No. If the panda has not quit by
                    morning, then I will have failed
                    you.
          
          Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
          continues around them.

<strong>          EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT
</strong>          
          A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
          Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
          locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
          patrol the perimeter.
          
          Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
          spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
          crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
          
<strong>                              ZENG
</strong>                    Wait wait wait! I bring a message
                    from Master Shifu.
          
          CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.

          The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
          staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.

          The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
          a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
          
<strong>                                 COMMANDER
</strong>                       Impressive, isn't it?
          
          A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.

          Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
          The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
          to scare the goose.
          
<strong>                                 ZENG

          The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
          sending an echo throughout the prison.
          
<strong>          AT DOORS -

          A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a

          They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
          in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
          barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
          to him.

                    got him completely immobilized.
          
          The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
          The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.

          Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.

          The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
          hurries after him.
          
          The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
          feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
          
          HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.

          The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
          guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
          
<strong>                              RHINO GUARD #1

                    Archers!
          
          Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
          the volley of arrows flies down past him.
          
          The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
          the bottom of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
          catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
          over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
          next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
          reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
          Rhino army await.

                    Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
          
          Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
          crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
          across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
          towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
          sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
          maniacally.
          
          On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
          down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
          raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
          
          Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
          ahead of him at the guards.

          everywhere.
          
          WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
          prosthetic falls in front of him.
          
<strong>                              ZENG

          With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
          ruffled feathers.

                    learn to do a full split in one
                    night? It takes years to develop
                    one's flexibility and years longer
                    to apply it in combat.
          
          Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
          leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
          As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
          Po, knocking him on the head.
          
          Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
          notices and steps forward.

          Shifu snaps.
          
          We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
          hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
          Mantis.

                    Oogway saw darkness in his heart
                    and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung

                    Shifu had to destroy what he had
                    created.
          
          Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
          He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu

          and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
          
          Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
          strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a

</strong>                    My old friend, the panda will never
                    fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
                    until you let go of the illusion of
                    control.
          
<strong>                                SHIFU
</strong>                    Illusion?
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
                    cannot make it blossom when it
                    suits me, nor make it bear fruit
                    before its time.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    But there are things we can
                    control.
          
          Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    I can control when the fruit will
                    fall.
          
          A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
          the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    And I can control--
          
          Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
          in it.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    --where to plant the seed. That is
                    no illusion, Master.
          
<strong>                                                                 51.

<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
                    that seed will grow to be a peach
                    tree. You may wish for an apple, or
                    an orange... but you will get a
                    peach.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Maybe it can. If you are willing to
                    guide it, to nurture it. To believe
                    in it.
          
          Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    But how? How? I need your help,
                    Master.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    No, you just need to believe.
                    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
                    will believe.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    I... I will try.
          
          Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
          Shifu.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    Good. My time has come. You must
                    continue your journey without me.
          
          He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    What... what are you..?
          
          Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Master, you can't leave me!
          
          The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
          
<strong>                              OOGWAY
</strong>                    You must believe.

</strong>          
          
          Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
          As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
          of a cliff.
          
          Oogway is gone.
          
          We pan across to the bunkhouse.

          Po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. He
          ladles soup into them.

          Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
          he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
          it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.

          bowls and holds them up like ears.

          As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to
          smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks
          up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
          
          Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's

          Night dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He

          some amazing Kung Fu.
          
          Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face
          with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
          
          In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --
          broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.

          waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
          
          KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
          perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his

          Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.
          
<strong>                               SHIFU (CONT'D)

          Po raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches
          the dumpling away and eats it himself.

          Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks
          the dumpling into the air.

          Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and
          sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and
          Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
          left.
          
          Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
          hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
          as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
          his bamboo staff.
          
          But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
          dumpling.
          
          Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
          
          But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.

<strong>          EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS
</strong>          
          The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain
          peaks.
          
<strong>                                                                  64.
</strong>          
          
          Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
          races toward them.
          
<strong>                              TIGRESS
</strong>                    Cut it!
          
          The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
          mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
          final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
          herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
          bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
          Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong>                    Where's the Dragon Warrior?

                    at her?
          
          Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong>                    You think I'm a fool? I know you're
                    not the Dragon Warrior. None of
                    you!
          
          The Five exchange quick, worried looks.

</strong>                        (nodding confidently)
                    I heard how he fell out of the sky
                    on a ball of fire, that he's a
                    warrior unlike anything the world
                    has ever seen.
          
          The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
          
<strong>                              MONKEY
</strong>                    Po?
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong>                    So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
                    a worthy opponent. Our battle will
                    be legendary!
          
          Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
          Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
          with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
          the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
          bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
          
<strong>                              MONKEY
</strong>                    We've got this. Help her!
          
<strong>                                                                     65.
</strong>          
          
          Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
          ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
          manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
          his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
          "throat".
          
<strong>                              VIPER
</strong>                    Monkey!
          
          ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
          rope by himself.
          
<strong>                              MANTIS
</strong>                    Go!
                        (then)
                    Ack! What was I thinking?!
          
          Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
          sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
          back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
          strand of rope.
          
<strong>                              TIGRESS
</strong>                    Mantis!
          
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
          shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
          and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
          
<strong>                              TIGRESS (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Now!
          
          Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
          way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
          Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
          safely to the mountain.
          
          The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
          
          Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
          the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
          whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
          
          With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong>                    Shifu taught you well...
          
          Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong>                    But he didn't teach you everything.
          
<strong>                                                                     66.
</strong>          
          
          Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
          
          
<strong>          EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
</strong>          
          Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
          easy spring in his step.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU

                    awesome!
          
          He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
          
          Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    The mark of a true hero is
                    humility!
          
          After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    But yes...you have done awesome.
          
          And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
          they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
          them. IT'S CRANE!
          
          Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
          heap.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Huh? Guys? Guys!
          
          Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.

          Crane struggles to lift his head.
          
<strong>                              CRANE

          Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
          Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
          
<strong>                              MONKEY
</strong>                    He's too fast!
          
          He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
          realizes where he is.

          Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.

<strong>          INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</strong>          
          CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
          looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
          
<strong>                              PO

          They look at each other. This is a big moment.
          
          Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
          and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
          reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
          closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
          others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
          flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
          tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
          Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
          mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
          with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
          to Po, holding it out.

          Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
          pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.

          He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
          the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
          light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,

          On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.

          Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane

</strong>          
          
          A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</strong>                    But when Oogway said otherwise,
                    what did you do? What did you do?!
          
          Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
          dissolves into the present.
          
<strong>                                 TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                    NOTHING!
</strong>          
          Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    You were not meant to be the Dragon
                    Warrior! That was not my fault!
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong><strong>                    NOT YOUR FAULT?!
</strong>          
          Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
          throws them at Shifu.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                    WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!

</strong><strong>                    DESTINY?!
</strong>          
          Shifu dodges each attack.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    It was never my decision to make!
          
          Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
          
<strong>                                 TAI LUNG
</strong>                    It is now.
          
          They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Give me the scroll!
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    I would rather die.
          
          They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
          into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
          
<strong>                                                                   76.
</strong>          
          
          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
          sends them both crashing through the roof.
          
          Lightning flash.
          
          Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
          throat as they crash back through the roof.
          
          They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
          charges at Shifu.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG
</strong>                    All I ever did, I did to make you
                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,
                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
          
          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                        (weakly)
                    I have always been proud of you.
                    From the first moment, I've been
                    proud of you. And it was my pride
                    that blinded me. I loved you too
                    much to see what you were becoming.
                    What I was turning you into. I'm...
                    sorry.
          
          Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
          expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
          
<strong>                               TAI LUNG
</strong>                    I don't want your apology. I want
                    my scroll!
          
          He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
          bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                    WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
</strong>          
          Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU

</strong>          
          
          Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
          Suddenly...
          
<strong>                               PO (O.S.)
</strong>                    Hey!
          
          Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.

          Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.

<strong>                              TAI LUNG

                    He's a panda.
                        (back to Po)
                    You're a panda. What are you gonna
                    do, big guy? Sit on me?
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
                    use this. You want it? Come and get
                    it.
          
          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
          
          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
          
<strong>                               TAI LUNG
</strong>                    Finally!
          
          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
          run.
          
          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
          steps.
          
          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
          
<strong>                                                                    78.
</strong>          
          
          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
          right back at Po.
          
<strong>                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong>                    That scroll is mine!
          
          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
          noodle.
          
          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
          street.
          
          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
          to hide the scroll.
          
<strong>                                 PO
</strong>                    Lightning!
          
          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
          rolls down the steps towards the river.
          
          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
          fireworks-filled sky.
          
          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
          shocked.
          
<strong>                               TAI LUNG
</strong>                    The scroll has given him power.
                        (then)
<strong>                    NOOO0!!
</strong>          
          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
          shockwave collapses the building.
          
<strong>                                                                    79.
</strong>          
          
          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
          punch.
          
          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
          impact crater.
          
<strong>                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong>                          (out of breath)
                      Finally... oh yes... the power of
                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
          
          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
          
<strong>                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
</strong>                      It's NOTHING!!
          
          Po stirs.
          
<strong>                                PO
</strong>                      It's okay. I didn't get it the

                      What?
          
          Po gets to his feet.
          
<strong>                                PO
</strong>                      There is no secret ingredient. It's

          Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
          
<strong>                                   TAI LUNG

</strong><strong>                      AAAAGGGHH!
</strong>          
          Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.

          Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
          delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
          
<strong>                                                                  80.
</strong>          
          
          The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
          come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
          back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
          he just did.
          
          Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
          strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
          getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
          prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
          He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
          finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
          ground.
          
          Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.

          A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
          Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.

          looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
          
<strong>                              KG SHAW
</strong>                    Look! The Dragon Warrior.
          
          As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
          his scarf is a torn apron.
          
          Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
          crowd.
          
<strong>                              PO'S DAD
</strong>                    That's my boy. That big, lovely
                    kung fu warrior is my son!
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Thanks, Dad.
          
          Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
          ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
          of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.

          Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.

                        (then, remembering)
                    Master Shifu!
          
          Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
          more steps.
          
<strong>                                                                  82.

<strong>          INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
</strong>          
          Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
          lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
          side.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
          
          Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    Po! You're alive!
                        (then, darkly)
                    Or we're both dead.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    No, Master, I didn't die. I
                    defeated Tai Lung!
          
<strong>                                SHIFU
</strong>                    You did?!
          
          Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
          
<strong>                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
</strong>                    Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
                    You are the Dragon Warrior. You
                    have brought peace to this Valley.
                    And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
                    Po. Thank you...
          
          Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
                    Shifu. Please...
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                        (eyes snapping open)
                    I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
                    Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
                    peace. Finally.
          
<strong>                              PO
</strong>                    Oh. So, um, I should...stop
                    talking?
          
<strong>                              SHIFU
</strong>                    If you can.
          
          Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
          pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
          away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.

</strong>          
          
          He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
          for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
