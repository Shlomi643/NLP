<p>FADE IN:</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM</p>

<p>A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They</p>
<p>are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.</p>
<p>The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the</p>
<p>impression of sky.</p>

<p>One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "WANTED"</p>
<p>poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.</p>

<p>A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The</p>
<p>VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting</p>
<p>out all the voices of the scene.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;Alright everyone, this is a stick-</p>
<p>;;;up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty</p>
<p>;;;that safe!</p>

<p>A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the</p>
<p>"BANK" box.</p>

<p>Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.</p>
<p>Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.</p>
<p>Potato Head kisses the coins.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.</p>
<p>```(kissing noises)</p>


<p>A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought</p>
<p>into the scene.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS BO PEEP)</p>
<p>;;;Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old</p>
<p>;;;potato!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get</p>
<p>;;;run over!</p>

<p>The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a</p>
<p>Hot Wheels track loop.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS SHEEP)</p>
<p>;;;Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS BO PEEP)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do</p>
<p>;;;something!</p>

<p>WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene</p>
<p>opposite the inanimate spud.</p>

<p>Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.</p>

<p>___WOODY (VOICE BOX)</p>
<p>;;;Reach for the sky.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS WOODY)</p>
<p>;;;I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.</p>

<p>Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS WOODY)</p>
<p>;;;Are you gonna come quietly?</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)</p>
<p>;;;You can't touch me Sheriff!  I</p>
<p>;;;brought my attack dog with a built-</p>
<p>;;;in force field!</p>

<p>Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in</p>
<p>front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS WOODY)</p>
<p>;;;Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who</p>
<p>;;;eats force field dogs!!</p>

<p>Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the</p>
<p>Slinky Dog.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)</p>
<p>;;;AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)</p>
<p>;;;YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS WOODY)</p>
<p>;;;You're goin' to jail, Bart.</p>

<p>Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib</p>
<p>in the room.</p>

<p>A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "JAIL"</p>
<p>written in crayon.</p>

<p>___ANDY (AS WOODY)</p>
<p>;;;Say good-bye to the wife and</p>
<p>;;;tatertots.</p>

<p>Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.</p>
<p>Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to</p>
<p>pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,</p>
<p>forcing some of his parts loose.</p>

<p>Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the</p>
<p>floor.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>```(pulling Woody's string)</p>
<p>;;;You saved the day again, Woody.</p>

<p>___WOODY (VOICE BOX)</p>
<p>;;;You're my favorite deputy.</p>

<p>BEGIN TITLES</p>

<p>SONG "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME" plays while Andy does</p>
<p>various activities with Woody:</p>

<p>-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows</p>
<p>drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends</p>
<p>Woody is lassoing the cattle.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.</p>

<p>-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)</p>
<p>car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib.</p>

<p>INT. STAIRWELL</p>

<p>-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister</p>
<p>allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and</p>
<p>catches him at the bottom.</p>

<p>INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM</p>

<p>-- Andy &amp; Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around</p>
<p>and around.</p>

<p>Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.</p>

<p>Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>```(raising his arms)</p>
<p>;;;Score!</p>

<p>SONG ENDS</p>

<p>Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to</p>
<p>his mother.</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Wow!  Cool!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Whadda ya think?</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!</p>

<p>ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM</p>

<p>MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just</p>
<p>finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A</p>
<p>banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: "Happy</p>
<p>Birthday Andy."</p>

<p>Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday</p>
<p>decorations.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Can we leave this up 'til we move?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Well, sure, we can leave it up.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Yeah!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Now go get Molly.  Your friends are</p>
<p>;;;going to be here any minute.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Okay.</p>

<p>Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;It's party time, Woody!</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging</p>
<p>Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat</p>
<p>at her.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Howdy, Little Lady!</p>

<p>He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last</p>
<p>time.</p>

<p>___WOODY (VOICE BOX)</p>
<p>;;;Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>```(picking up Molly)</p>
<p>;;;C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting</p>
<p>;;;heavy!</p>
<p>```(to Woody)</p>
<p>;;;See ya later, Woody.</p>

<p>Andy exits.</p>

<p>END TITLES</p>

<p>Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his</p>
<p>expression changing from a smile to worry.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to himself)</p>
<p>;;;Pull my string!  The birthday</p>
<p>;;;party's today?!</p>

<p>Woody thinks.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to the room)</p>
<p>;;;Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.</p>

<p>The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the</p>
<p>closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.</p>

<p>POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits</p>
<p>himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Ages three and up.  It's on my box.</p>
<p>;;;Ages three and up!  I'm not</p>
<p>;;;supposed to be babysitting Princess</p>
<p>;;;Drool.</p>

<p>HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin</p>
<p>slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces</p>
<p>are in the wrong slots.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!</p>
<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;I don't get it.</p>

<p>Hamm walks away.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;You uncultured swine!</p>
<p>```(to someone O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;What are you looking at, ya hockey</p>
<p>;;;puck?!</p>

<p>Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.</p>

<p>Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.</p>
<p>He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on</p>
<p>the night stand.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?</p>

<p>___SARGENT</p>
<p>```(saluting)</p>
<p>;;;Sir!  No Sir!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Okay, thank you.  At ease.</p>

<p>Woody hops off the bed.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey, Slinky?</p>

<p>___SLINKY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Right here, Woody!</p>

<p>A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing</p>
<p>out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on</p>
<p>the board.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;I'm red this time.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;No, Slink --</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Oh...well alright, you can be red</p>
<p>;;;if you want.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad</p>
<p>;;;news.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Bad news?!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Sh-h-h-h-h!!</p>

<p>Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in</p>
<p>the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(whispering)</p>
<p>;;;Just gather everyone up for a staff</p>
<p>;;;meeting and be happy!!</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Got it.</p>

<p>Slinky shuffles off.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Be HAPPY!</p>

<p>Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.</p>

<p>Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy</p>
<p>ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to the room)</p>
<p>;;;Staff meeting, everybody.</p>
<p>```(aside)</p>
<p>;;;Snake, Robot -- podium duty.</p>

<p>Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly</p>
<p>follow Woody.</p>

<p>Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other</p>
<p>direction.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey Etch!  Draw!</p>

<p>Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.</p>

<p>Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch</p>
<p>etches a gun on its screen.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(pretending to be shot)</p>
<p>;;;Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've</p>
<p>;;;been working on that draw.  Fastest</p>
<p>;;;knobs in the west.</p>

<p>Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Got a staff meeting, you guys, come</p>
<p>;;;on, let's go!</p>

<p>Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of</p>
<p>Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,</p>
<p>;;;who moved my doodle pad way over here?</p>

<p>Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and</p>
<p>walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...</p>

<p>REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;ROOAAAARR!!!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(unaffected)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, how ya doin', Rex?</p>

<p>Rex suddenly turns timid.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;I was close to being scared that time.</p>

<p>Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;I'm going for fearsome here, but I</p>
<p>;;;just don't feel it.  I think I'm</p>
<p>;;;just coming off as annoying.</p>

<p>A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO</p>
<p>PEEP, the porcelain figurine.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(choking)</p>
<p>;;;Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;I wanted to thank you, Woody, for</p>
<p>;;;saving my flock.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(blushing)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, hey - it was nothing.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;Whadda ya say I get someone else to</p>
<p>;;;watch the sheep tonight?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(very flustered)</p>
<p>;;;Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...</p>

<p>Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of</p>
<p>ABC blocks.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;Remember, I'm just a couple of</p>
<p>;;;blocks away.</p>

<p>Woody is left lovestruck.</p>

<p>All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up</p>
<p>;;;front.</p>

<p>Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Hey, Woody!  C'mon!</p>

<p>Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.</p>

<p>The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.</p>
<p>MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and</p>
<p>indicates his microphone.</p>

<p>___MIKE</p>
<p>;;;Ahem!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(grabbing microphone)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, thanks, Mike.</p>
<p>```(to the crowd)</p>
<p>;;;Okay --</p>

<p>SFX: FEEDBACK</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to Mike)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, whoa, step back --</p>

<p>Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.</p>
<p>;;;Everybody hear me?  Up on the</p>
<p>;;;shelf, can you hear me?  Great!</p>
<p>;;;Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.</p>
<p>;;;Has everyone picked a moving buddy?</p>

<p>The toys all MOAN.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Well I didn't know we were supposed</p>
<p>;;;to have one already.</p>

<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>```(waving his arm out</p>
<p>```its socket)</p>
<p>;;;Do we have to hold hands?</p>

<p>The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a</p>
<p>;;;big joke.  We've only got one week</p>
<p>;;;left before the move.  I don't want</p>
<p>;;;any toys left behind.  A moving</p>
<p>;;;buddy -- if you don't have one, get</p>
<p>;;;one!</p>
<p>```(checking the pad)</p>
<p>;;;Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.</p>
<p>;;;Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion</p>
<p>;;;Awareness" meeting was, I think, a</p>
<p>;;;big success and we want to thank Mr.</p>
<p>;;;Spell for putting that on for us.</p>

<p>The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr. Spell's display</p>
<p>screen as he speaks.</p>

<ol>
<li> SPELL</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;You're welcome.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note</p>

<p>```(under his breath)</p>
<p>;;;Andy's birthday party's been moved</p>
<p>;;;to today.</p>

<p>;;;Next we have --</p>

<p>The toys all PANIC.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's</p>
<p>;;;today?!  His birthday's not 'til</p>
<p>;;;next week!!</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;What's going on down there?  Is Mom</p>
<p>;;;losing her marbles?!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Well, obviously she wanted to have</p>
<p>;;;the party before the move.  I'm not</p>
<p>;;;worried.  You shouldn't be worried.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Of course Woody ain't worried!</p>
<p>;;;He's been Andy's favorite since</p>
<p>;;;kindergarten!</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!</p>
<p>;;;If Woody says it's all right, then,</p>
<p>;;;well, darnit, it's good enough for</p>
<ol>
<li>Woody has never steered us</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;wrong before.</p>

<p>While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and</p>
<p>mimes kissing his own butt.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and</p>
<p>;;;birthday we go through this.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;But what if Andy gets another</p>
<p>;;;dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just</p>
<p>;;;don't think I can take that kind of</p>
<p>;;;rejection.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey, listen, no one's getting</p>
<p>;;;replaced.  This is Andy we're</p>
<p>;;;talking about.</p>

<p>Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(continued)</p>

<p>;;;Birthday guests at three o'clock!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Stay calm, everyone!!</p>

<p>Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards</p>
<p>the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh, meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get</p>
<p>a peek outside.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at</p>
<p>;;;all those presents?!</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;I can't see a thing!</p>

<p>Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out</p>
<p>of his head and holds them up over the other toys.</p>

<p>ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD</p>

<p>CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Yessir, we're next month's garage</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Alright!  Alright!</p>

<p>The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.</p>

<p>;;;Okay, save your batteries!</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using</p>
<p>;;;the old noodle.</p>

<p>Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on</p>
<p>the nightstand.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Sargent.  Establish a recon post</p>
<p>;;;downstairs.  Code red.  You know</p>

<p>;;;Alright men, you heard him.  Code</p>
<p>;;;Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!</p>

<p>;;;Let's move move move!!</p>

<p>THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in</p>
<p>formation across the bedroom floor.</p>

<p>INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY</p>

<p>Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth</p>
<p>to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for</p>
<p>the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the</p>
<p>hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.</p>

<p>The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and</p>
<p>hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene</p>
<p>below through his binoculars.</p>

<p>ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS</p>

<p>Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway</p>
<p>rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the</p>
<p>;;;living room.  It's almost time for</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the</p>
<p>Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.</p>

<p>TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting</p>
<p>down to the floor below.</p>

<p>INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,</p>
<p>then give the "all clear" sign.</p>

<p>The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM</p>

<p>The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed</p>
<p>the receiving half of the baby monitor.</p>

<p>The green army men march in formation across the floor when</p>
<p>suddenly...</p>

<p>SFX: FOOTSTEPS</p>

<p>Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen</p>
<p>door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze</p>
<p>in their various classic action poses.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the</p>
<p>;;;chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and</p>
<p>;;;Barbeque --</p>

<p>The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top</p>
<p>of a soldier.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,</p>
<p>;;;I thought I told him to pick these up.</p>

<p>With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of</p>
<p>her path and continues on to the living room.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Shouldn't they be there by now?</p>

<p>;;;Hey, these guys are professionals.</p>
<p>;;;They're the best.  C'mon, they're</p>
<p>;;;not lying down on the job.</p>

<p>INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY</p>

<p>As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to</p>
<p>proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the</p>
<p>living room.</p>

<p>The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to</p>
<p>drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The</p>
<p>Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.</p>

<p>;;;A good soldier never leaves a man</p>
<p>;;;behind.</p>

<p>The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower</p>
<p>themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once</p>
<p>downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the</p>
<p>houseplant.  Suddenly...</p>

<p>A BALL</p>

<p>bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps</p>
<p>and kid clamor.</p>

<p>The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,</p>
<p>right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They</p>
<p>conceal themselves in the house plant just before the</p>
<p>children run by.</p>

<p>INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates</p>
<p>the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal.</p>

<p>The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.</p>

<p>Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the</p>
<p>edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...</p>

<p>BUZZ LIGHTYEAR</p>

<p>We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age</p>
<p>action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head</p>
<p>to toe.  The imposing "G.I. Joe-sized" doll stands heroically</p>
<p>in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.</p>

<p>Woody GULPS.</p>

<p>Buzz comes alive and looks around.</p>

<p>ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET</p>

<p>;;;My ship!!</p>

<p>He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>

<p>his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and</p>
<p>holds it there.</p>

<p>;;;To infinity and beyond!!</p>

<p>...and leaps off the bed.</p>

<p>Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and</p>
<p>bounces right back up.</p>

<p>He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the</p>
<p>track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward</p>
<p>into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact</p>
<p>turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around</p>
<p>and around.</p>

<p>All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized.</p>

<p>Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from</p>
<p>the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed.</p>

<p>Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and</p>
<p>then opens his eyes.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Can.</p>

<p>The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH</p>
<p>ADORATION.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew</p>
<p>;;;magnificently!</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;I found my moving buddy!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Why, thank you.  Thank you all.</p>
<p>;;;Thank you.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;That wasn't flying!  That was</p>
<p>;;;falling with style!</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Man, the dolls must really go for</p>
<p>;;;you!</p>
<p>```(aside)</p>
<p>;;;Can you teach me that?</p>

<p>Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming.</p>
<p>Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,</p>
<p>;;;everything will be just the way it</p>
<p>;;;was.  They'll see... they'll see.</p>
<p>;;;I'm still Andy's favorite toy.</p>

<p>MONTAGE</p>

<p>SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER</p>

<ol>
<li>A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,</li>
</ol>
<p>running around the room.</p>

<ol>
<li>B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor. Next he "lands" Buzz</li>
</ol>
<p>Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's</p>
<p>laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if</p>
<p>he'd been blown away by the laser.</p>

<ol>
<li>C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and</li>
</ol>
<p>cowboy pajamas.</p>

<p>```MATCH CUT TO:</p>

<p>Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas</p>
<p>and a homemade spaceman's helmet.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.</p>

<ol>
<li>D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom</li>
</ol>
<p>transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the</p>
<p>wall, the pillow, the bedspread.</p>

<ol>
<li>E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR. The space ranger</li>
</ol>
<p>suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this</p>
<p>time giving a "JURASSIC PARK" ROAR.</p>

<p>The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.</p>

<ol>
<li>F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of</li>
</ol>
<p>Buzz.</p>

<p>Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's</p>
<p>hair, chatting away like a hair dresser.</p>

<p>Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.</p>

<ol>
<li>G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys</li>
</ol>
<p>as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,</p>
<p>using his feet as a treadmill.</p>

<p>Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends</p>
<p>up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the</p>
<p>barbell.</p>

<ol>
<li>H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the</li>
</ol>
<p>checkerboard.</p>

<p>Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and</p>
<p>Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on</p>
<p>top of ABC blocks for repair.</p>

<p>In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the</p>
<p>pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the</p>
<p>dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.</p>

<ol>
<li>I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is</li>
</ol>
<p>stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's</p>
<p>wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.</p>

<p>Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his</p>
<p>front end no choice but to eventually follow.</p>

<ol>
<li>J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until</li>
</ol>
<p>just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which</p>
<p>toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>

<p>Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next</p>
<p>to him.</p>

<p>Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks</p>
<p>back into the box, closing the lid to...</p>

<p>BLACK</p>

<p>END MONTAGE/SONG ENDS</p>

<p>The black screen splits horizontally to become...</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - MORNING - WOODY'S POV OF THE BEDROOM</p>
<p>FROM THE TOY BOX</p>

<p>All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid</p>
<p>of the toy box.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Finally!</p>

<p>He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers</p>
<p>that his hat is missing.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(looking back into</p>
<p>```the toy box)</p>
<p>;;;Hey!  Who's got my hat?</p>

<p>The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.</p>

<p>___SHARK</p>
<p>;;;Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(sarcastic)</p>
<p>;;;Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!</p>
<p>```(grabs the hat)</p>
<p>;;;Give me that!</p>

<p>Woody leaps out of the toy box.</p>

<p>___BUZZ (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.</p>
<p>;;;Let me show you something.  It</p>
<p>;;;looks as though I've been accepted</p>
<p>;;;into your culture.</p>

<p>Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>```(continued)</p>
<p>;;;Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his</p>
<p>;;;name on me.</p>

<p>Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the</p>
<p>sole of his boot.</p>

<p>The name "ANDY" is written on it in permanent marker.</p>

<p>___SLINKY &amp; REX</p>
<p>;;;Wow!</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;With permanent ink, too!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Well, I must get back to repairing</p>
<p>;;;my ship.</p>

<p>Buzz walks away.</p>

<p>Woody looks at HIS foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but</p>
<p>in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Don't let it get to you, Woody.</p>

<p>Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly</p>
<p>straightens up.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(nonchalant)</p>
<p>;;;Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what</p>
<p>;;;do you mean?  Who?</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;I know Andy's excited about Buzz,</p>
<p>;;;but you know, he'll always have a</p>
<p>;;;special place for you.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>```(walking past)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Alright!  That's it!</p>

<p>Woody angrily marches across the room.</p>

<p>Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the</p>
<p>ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under</p>
<p>the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting</p>
<p>for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Unidirectional bonding strip.</p>

<p>Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape</p>
<p>dispenser.</p>

<p>___ROBOT</p>
<p>;;;Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!</p>

<p>Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.</p>

<p>Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot</p>
<p>and rolls him out from under the ship.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away</p>
<p>;;;from Andy.  He's mine, and no one</p>
<p>;;;is taking him away from me.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;What are you talking about?</p>
<p>```(to Robot)</p>
<p>;;;Where's that bonding strip?!</p>

<p>Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;And another thing.  Stop with this</p>
<p>;;;spaceman thing.  It's getting on my</p>
<p>;;;nerves.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Are you saying you want to lodge a</p>
<p>;;;complaint with Star Command?</p>
<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh okay, so you want to do it the</p>
<p>;;;hard way, huh?</p>

<p>Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Don't even think about it, cowboy!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, yeah, tough guy?!</p>

<p>Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a</p>
<p>button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.</p>

<p>Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees</p>
<p>and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath.</p>

<p>Woody is unsure how to react.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;The air isn't toxic.</p>

<p>Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;How dare you open a spaceman's</p>
<p>;;;helmet on an uncharted planet!  My</p>
<p>;;;eyeballs could've been sucked from</p>
<p>;;;their sockets!</p>

<p>Buzz closes his helmet.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;You actually think you're THE "Buzz</p>
<p>;;;Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I</p>
<p>;;;thought it was an act!</p>
<p>```(to the room)</p>
<p>;;;Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL</p>
<p>;;;Buzz Lightyear!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;You're mocking me, aren't you?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no, no, no...</p>
<p>```(pointing behind Buzz)</p>
<p>;;;Buzz, look!  An alien!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Where?</p>

<p>Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.</p>

<p>Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.</p>

<p>SFX: DOG BARKING</p>

<p>Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh-oh.</p>

<p>Slinky hides under the bed.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;It's Sid!</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;I thought he was at summer camp!</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;They must have kicked him out early</p>
<p>;;;this year.</p>

<p>The toys rush over to the window.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no!  Not Sid!</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;...Incoming!</p>

<p>From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-</p>
<p>old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping</p>
<p>around in their backyard.</p>

<p>A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.</p>
<p>Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his</p>
<p>leash, barking wildly.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Who is it this time?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?</p>

<p>___LENNY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Right here, Woody.</p>

<p>Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,</p>
<p>approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks</p>
<p>Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one</p>
<p>;;;of these again!</p>

<p>ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID'S BACKYARD</p>

<p>A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the</p>
<p>center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the</p>
<p>doll's back with masking tape.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(plays under the next</p>
<p>```5 lines)</p>
<p>;;;Just stay where you are, Corporal!</p>
<p>;;;Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.</p>
<p>;;;I know you're tired!  I know your</p>
<p>;;;leg is cramping, but you can't move.</p>
<p>;;;Do you hear me?</p>

<p>Buzz breaks through the crowd.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;What's going on?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Nothing that concerns you spacemen.</p>
<p>;;;Just us TOYS.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I'd better take a look anyway.</p>

<p>Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Why is that soldier strapped to an</p>
<p>;;;explosive device?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(redirecting Buzz's view)</p>
<p>;;;That's why.  Sid.</p>

<p>ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF THE DOG, SCUD</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Sure is a hairy fellah.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!</p>

<p>Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view.</p>

<p>ANGLE: BINOCULAR VIEW OF SID</p>

<p>He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;THAT is Sid!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;You mean that happy child?</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;That ain't no happy child.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;He tortures toys -- just for fun.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Well, then we've got to do something!</p>

<p>Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;What are you doing?!!  Get down</p>
<p>;;;from there!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I'm going to go teach that boy a</p>
<p>;;;lesson.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt</p>
<p>;;;him with your scary laser.</p>

<p>Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Be careful with that, it's</p>
<p>;;;extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting</p>
<p>the fuse of the M80.</p>

<p>___LENNY</p>
<p>;;;He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!</p>

<p>___LENNY</p>
<p>;;;Hit the dirt!</p>

<p>The toys jump away from the window.</p>

<p>SFX: EXPLOSION</p>

<p>Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of</p>
<p>Andy's house.</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!</p>

<p>Andy's toys peek over the window sill.</p>

<p>ANGLE: SID'S YARD</p>

<p>A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat</p>
<p>Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while</p>
<p>Scud resumes his BARKING.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I could have stopped him.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz, I would love to see you try.</p>
<p>```(gesturing to Sid's yard)</p>
<p>;;;'Course I'd love to see you as a</p>
<p>;;;crater.</p>

<p>Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;The sooner we move the better.</p>

<p>```DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>EXT. ANDY'S FRONT YARD - SUNSET</p>

<p>A "FOR SALE" real estate sign stands in the front yard.</p>
<p>Another sign reading "SOLD" hangs from the bottom.</p>

<p>INT. UPSTAIRS HALL/ANDY'S BEDROOM</p>

<p>Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is</p>
<p>full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is</p>
<p>playing with Woody and Buzz.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;To infinity and beyond!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, all this packing makes me</p>
<p>;;;hungry.  What would you say to</p>
<p>;;;dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!</p>

<p>Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right</p>
<p>on top of Woody.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Go wash your hands and I'll get</p>
<p>;;;Molly ready.</p>

<p>The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves</p>
<p>Buzz off of him.</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Can I bring some toys?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;You can bring ONE toy...</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Just one?</p>

<p>Woody perks up with concern.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to himself)</p>
<p>;;;One toy?</p>

<p>He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away</p>
<p>towards the opposite end of the desk.</p>

<p>Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.</p>
<p>With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(whispering)</p>
<p>;;;Will Andy pick me?</p>

<p>He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to</p>
<p>the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!</p>

<p>Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across</p>
<p>the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.</p>

<p>Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk</p>
<p>and peers down it.</p>

<p>ANGLE: BACK OF THE DESK</p>

<p>The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is</p>
<p>a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy.</p>

<p>Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.</p>

<p>He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's</p>
<p>pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with.</p>
<p>Right behind Buzz sits</p>

<p>THE RC CAR</p>

<p>It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the</p>
<p>8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.</p>

<p>Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!</p>
<p>;;;Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!</p>
<p>;;;We've got trouble!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Trouble?!</p>
<p>```(looking around)</p>
<p>;;;Where?!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(pointing to the back</p>
<p>```of the desk)</p>
<p>;;;Down there.  Just down there.  A</p>
<p>;;;helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Then we've no time to lose!!</p>

<p>Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I don't see anything!</p>

<p>Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.</p>
<p>RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep</p>
<p>;;;looking.</p>

<p>Woody hits the "FORWARD" button on the remote and steers the</p>
<p>RC Car straight for Buzz.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;What kind of a toy -- ?</p>

<p>Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out</p>
<p>of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...</p>

<p>A BULLETIN BOARD</p>

<p>The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz</p>
<p>ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk</p>
<p>like arrows.</p>

<p>POTATO HEAD</p>

<p>sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.</p>

<p>He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board</p>
<p>slams down onto...</p>

<p>A GLOBE</p>

<p>knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling</p>
<p>right at Buzz.</p>

<p>Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.</p>

<p>Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind</p>
<p>him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on</p>
<p>a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the</p>
<p>way onto the window ledge.</p>

<p>The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style</p>
<p>desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,</p>
<p>barely missing Woody...</p>

<p>...and knocks Buzz out the window.</p>

<p>___TOYS</p>
<p>;;;BUZZ!!!!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!!!</p>

<p>Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other</p>
<p>toys rush over to the sill.</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;I don't see him in the driveway!  I</p>
<p>;;;think he bounced into Sid's yard.</p>

<p>Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed.</p>

<p>;;;Buzz!</p>

<p>and down excitedly.</p>

<p>___TOYS</p>
<p>;;;WHAT?!?</p>

<p>The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Wait a minute.  You -- you don't</p>
<p>;;;think I meant to knock Buzz out the</p>

<p>;;;That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Now, it was an accident!  Guys,</p>
<p>;;;c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me</p>

<p>;;;We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>```(backing away)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, I don't like confrontations.</p>

<p>The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.</p>

<p>___SARGENT</p>
<p>;;;Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You</p>
<p>;;;are an absolute disgrace!  You</p>
<p>;;;don't deserve to --</p>

<p>Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.</p>

<p>Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.</p>

<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on</p>
<p>;;;your playtime, could ya Woody?</p>
<p>;;;Didn't want to face the fact that</p>
<p>;;;Buzz just might be Andy's new</p>

<p>;;;Well, what if Andy starts playin'</p>
<p>;;;with me more, Woody, huh?  You</p>
<p>;;;gonna knock me outta the window, too?</p>

<p>Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the</p>
<p>desk -- trapped.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;I don't think we should give him</p>
<p>;;;the chance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.</p>

<p>___SARGENT</p>
<p>;;;There he is, men!  Frag him!</p>

<p>The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the</p>

<p>;;;Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got</p>
<p>;;;to get Buzz.</p>

<p>___SARGENT</p>
<p>;;;Retreat!</p>

<p>The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.</p>

<p>Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where</p>
<p>Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching</p>
<p>around the room.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;No, I haven't seen him.</p>

<p>Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD (O.S.)</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Psssst!</p>

<p>Woody looks across the room.</p>

<p>Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.</p>
<p>Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head</p>
<p>points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.</p>

<p>Woody GULPS.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Andy!  I'm heading out the door.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;But Mom, I can't find him!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Well, honey, just grab some other</p>
<p>;;;toy!  Now c'mon!</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Okay...</p>

<p>He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.</p>

<p>EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the</p>
<p>family van in the driveway.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I</p>
<p>;;;left him right there.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Honey, I'm sure he's around.</p>
<p>;;;You'll find him.</p>

<p>A BUSH</p>

<p>next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,</p>
<p>revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a</p>
<p>slow burn.</p>

<p>The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and</p>
<p>with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it</p>
<p>pulls out of the driveway.</p>

<p>ANGLE: SIDE OF ANDY'S HOUSE</p>

<p>A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable</p>
<p>distance above the ground.</p>

<p>EXT. ANDY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,</p>
<p>supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>
<p>;;;It's too short!  We need more monkeys!</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>```(holding up an empty barrel)</p>
<p>;;;There aren't any more!  That's the</p>

<p>;;;Oh, where could he be?</p>

<p>EXT. GAS STATION - LATER</p>

<p>The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.</p>

<p>INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Can I help pump the gas?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Sure!  I'll even let you drive.</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly</p>
<p>sleeps up front in her car seat.</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah?!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Yeah -- when you're sixteen.</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(sarcastic)</p>
<p>;;;Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.</p>

<p>With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He</p>
<p>stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince</p>
<p>;;;those guys it was an accident?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!</p>

<p>Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!</p>
<p>;;;Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll</p>
<p>;;;find you here, he'll take us back</p>
<p>;;;to the room, and then you can tell</p>
<p>;;;everyone that this was all just a</p>
<p>;;;big mistake.  Huh?</p>

<p>No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(weakly)</p>
<p>;;;Right?  Buddy?</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I just want you to know that even</p>
<p>;;;though you tried to terminate me,</p>

<p>;;;Oh.  Oh, that's good.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>```(getting in Woody's face)</p>
<p>;;;But we're not on my planet, are we?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;No.</p>

<p>Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and</p>
<p>out the open side door of the van.</p>

<p>EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked</p>
<p>in mortal combat.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of</p>
<p>;;;me?!</p>

<p>Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.</p>

<p>Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the</p>
<p>face, making it SQUEAK with every blow.</p>

<p>Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Owwwww!!!</p>

<p>Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating</p>
<p>BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.</p>

<p>SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM</p>

<p>The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Next stop...</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!</p>

<p>The van drives off.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(GASP)</p>
<p>;;;Andy?!</p>

<p>Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it</p>
<p>drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Doesn't he realize that I'm not</p>
<p>;;;there?</p>
<p>```(beat)</p>
<p>;;;I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his</p>
<p>wrist communicator.</p>

<p>;;;Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The</p>
<p>;;;local Sheriff and I seem to be at a</p>

<p>Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to</p>
<p>seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;You!</p>

<p>SFX: LOUD TRUCK HORN</p>

<p>Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a</p>
<p>behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.</p>

<p>Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where</p>
<p>he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.</p>

<p>A GIGANTIC TIRE</p>

<p>stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.</p>

<p>Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back</p>
<p>under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.</p>

<p>EXT. GAS STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER</p>

<p>The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.</p>

<p>___PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the</p>

<p>his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.</p>

<p>Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.</p>

<p>Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of</p>

<p>his safety belt.</p>

<p>Woody to the back of the truck.</p>

<p>The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns</p>
<p>and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around</p>
<p>the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain.</p>

<p>The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time</p>

<p>Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold</p>
<p>back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.</p>

<p>INT. CRANE GAME</p>

<p>Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot</p>
<p>from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...</p>

<p>SQUEEZE TOY ALIENS</p>

<p>There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute.</p>

<p>___ALIENS</p>
<p>;;;Tell us!  What is it like outside?</p>

<p>The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.</p>

<p>EXT. CRANE GAME</p>

<p>With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane</p>
<p>game and dives through the prize slot.</p>

<p>INT. CRANE GAME - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.</p>

<p>___BUZZ (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;This is an intergalactic emergency!</p>
<p>;;;I need to commandeer your vessel to</p>
<p>;;;Sector 12!</p>

<p>Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by</p>
<p>the cute alien toys.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>

<p>All the aliens point upward.</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz look up.</p>

<p>ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW</p>

<p>It dangles directly above the toys.</p>

<p>___ALIEN #1</p>
<p>;;;The claw is our master.</p>

<p>___ALIEN #2</p>
<p>;;;The claw chooses who will go and</p>

<p>Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to</p>
<p>see Sid heading straight for the crane game.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no!  Sid!!!</p>

<p>Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the</p>
<p>two of them deep into the pile of aliens.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Get down!!</p>

<p>Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his</p>
<p>pants pocket.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>

<p>ANGLE: CLAW</p>

<p>It moves into position and hovers directly above the area</p>
<p>where Woody and Buzz are hiding.</p>

<p>The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is</p>
<p>right on top of Buzz.</p>

<p>___ALIEN #3</p>
<p>```(whispering excitedly)</p>
<p>;;;I have been chosen!!</p>

<p>Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by</p>
<p>the claw.</p>

<p>___ALIEN #3</p>
<p>```(continued)</p>
<p>;;;Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a</p>
<p>;;;better place.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Gotcha!</p>

<p>With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,</p>
<p>forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!</p>

<p>Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way</p>
<p>to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...</p>

<p>A SMALL REPAIR DOOR</p>

<p>Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.</p>
<p>He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few</p>
<p>attempts, is able to pry the door open.</p>

<p>The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and</p>
<p>grabs his head.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Yes!</p>

<p>The claw begins to lift Buzz up.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(GASP)</p>
<p>;;;Buzz, NO!</p>

<p>Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.</p>

<p>Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.</p>

<p>Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of</p>
<p>aliens, out of Sid's view.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>```(slamming his fist</p>
<p>```against the glass)</p>
<p>;;;Wha -- ?  Hey!!</p>

<p>Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the</p>
<p>door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the</p>
<p>pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.</p>

<p>___ALIEN #4</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the</p>
<p>air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Alright!  Double prizes!</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and</p>
<p>snatched up by Sid.</p>

<p>From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He</p>
<p>is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his</p>
<p>backpack in his hand.</p>

<p>Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path</p>
<p>towards the front door.</p>

<p>Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to</p>
<p>see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.</p>

<p>INT. BACKPACK - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the</p>
<p>backpack.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>

<p>The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges</p>
<p>straight for the backpack, BARKING.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good</p>
<p>;;;boy!</p>

<p>The dog begrudgingly obeys.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.</p>

<p>Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(loud whisper)</p>
<p>;;;FREEZE!!!</p>

<p>The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the</p>
<p>backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's</p>
<p>snout.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Ready, set, NOW.</p>

<p>In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in</p>
<p>his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.</p>

<p>Buzz and Woody react in horror.</p>

<p>___SID</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as</p>
<p>Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.</p>

<p>He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a</p>
<p>pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the</p>
<p>monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.</p>

<p>___HANNAH</p>
<p>;;;MOM!!  MOM!!</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;She's lying!  Whatever she says</p>
<p>;;;it's not true!</p>

<p>Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,</p>
<p>slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new</p>
<p>surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains</p>
<p>and power tools adorn the messy room.</p>

<p>They are in Hell...toy Hell.</p>

<p>Woody is startled by the noise.</p>

<p>A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its</p>
<p>side.</p>

<p>Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes</p>
<p>it like a weapon.</p>

<p>Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but</p>
<p>sees nothing.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?</p>

<p>Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.</p>

<p>He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the</p>
<p>flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the</p>
<p>noise, illuminating...</p>

<p>;;;Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!</p>

<p>pieces.</p>

<p>The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.</p>
<p>Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on</p>
<p>BABYFACE.</p>

<p>Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:</p>
<p>a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with</p>
<p>a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-</p>
<p>in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others).</p>

<p>Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;B-B-B-Buzz!</p>

<p>Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as</p>
<p>they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them</p>
<p>off into the shadows.</p>

<p>;;;Hey, you guys!  I think I've found</p>

<p>meets up with Buzz.</p>

<p>WOODY'S PULLSTRING RING</p>

<p>gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.</p>

<p>Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND</p>

<p>Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the</p>
<p>desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Go away, you disgusting freaks!</p>

<p>Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his</p>
<p>erector-set pinchers.</p>

<p>Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm.</p>

<p>Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!</p>

<p>Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,</p>
<p>crashing into the wall.</p>

<p>By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of</p>
<p>mutant toys.</p>

<p>Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;He is still alive, and you're not</p>
<p>;;;gonna get him, you monsters!</p>

<p>He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way</p>
<p>to...</p>

<p>BUZZ</p>

<p>He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached.</p>

<p>Woody's anger turns to confusion.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!</p>

<p>Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real</p>
<p>when he looks to the mutants.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(continued)</p>
<p>;;;But -- but they're cannibals.  We</p>
<p>;;;saw them eat those other toys.</p>

<p>The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's</p>
<p>last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their</p>
<p>heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.</p>

<p>The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you</p>
<p>;;;were gonna...</p>
<p>```(laughs nervously)</p>
<p>;;;...you know, eat my friend.</p>

<p>Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark</p>
<p>corners of the room.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's</p>
<p>;;;wrong?</p>

<p>___SID'S MOM (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Sid!</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Sid!!!</p>

<p>FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the</p>
<p>still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,</p>
<p>;;;you're...</p>
<p>```(GRUNT)</p>
<p>;;;...get up...</p>

<p>Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their</p>
<p>progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But</p>
<p>;;;don't blame me.</p>

<p>Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor</p>
<p>and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...</p>

<p>Sid enters carrying a big box.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;It came!  It finally came!</p>

<p>Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>```(reverently)</p>
<p>;;;The big one.</p>

<p>He pulls out a rocket with "THE BIG ONE" written on it.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>```(reading the rocket label)</p>
<p>;;;"Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of</p>
<p>;;;reach of children."  COOL...</p>
<p>```(looks around)</p>
<p>;;;What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,</p>
<p>;;;where's that wimpy cowboy doll?</p>

<p>Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.</p>

<p>No Woody.</p>

<p>ANGLE: UNDERSIDE OF MILKCRATE</p>

<p>Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging</p>
<p>on for dear life.</p>

<p>SFX: BUZZ'S LASER</p>

<p>Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating</p>
<p>his laser.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Yes!  I've always wanted to put a</p>
<p>;;;spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.</p>

<p>He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws</p>
<p>a toolbox on top of the crate.</p>

<p>The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding</p>
<p>place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of</p>
<p>the crate "jail."</p>

<p>Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of</p>
<p>electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT</p>
<p>CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket.</p>

<p>SFX: THUNDERCLAP</p>

<p>A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Oh, no...</p>

<p>Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.</p>
<p>Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Aw, man...!</p>

<p>Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the</p>
<p>rain to the Buzzrocket.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>```(as Newscaster)</p>
<p>;;;Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of</p>
<p>;;;the shuttle has been delayed due to</p>

<p>Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and</p>
<p>places it next to Buzz.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT</p>

<p>Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him</p>
<p>his cowboy hat.</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;I looked everywhere, honey, but all</p>
<p>;;;I could find was your hat.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>```(groggy)</p>
<p>;;;But what if we leave them behind?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure</p>
<p>;;;we'll find Woody and Buzz before we</p>
<p>;;;leave tomorrow.</p>

<p>Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits</p>
<p>the room.</p>

<p>A moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys!"</p>
<p>scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.</p>

<p>___REX (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(muffled)</p>
<p>;;;Aaaah!  I need air!</p>

<p>Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing</p>
<p>styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears</p>
<p>beside him.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>```(relieved)</p>
<p>;;;Aa-a-a-a-ah!</p>
<p>```(COUGH)</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Will you quit moving around?!</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so</p>
<p>;;;nervous before I travel.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;How did I get stuck with YOU as a</p>
<p>;;;moving buddy?</p>

<p>Potato Head drops back down into the box.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>```(following Potato Head)</p>
<p>;;;Everyone else was picked.</p>

<p>BO PEEP</p>

<p>peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at</p>
<p>Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;Oh, Woody, if only you could see</p>
<p>;;;how much Andy misses you.</p>

<p>EXT. SID'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT</p>

<p>THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.</p>

<p>INT. SID'S ROOM</p>

<p>Sid is in bed fast asleep.</p>

<p>Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the</p>
<p>weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.</p>

<p>Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly</p>
<p>with the rocket strapped to his back.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!</p>

<p>No reaction from Buzz.</p>

<p>Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it</p>
<p>at Buzz, striking his helmet.</p>

<p>Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey!  Get over here and see if you</p>
<p>;;;can get this tool box off me.</p>

<p>Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I</p>
<p>;;;can't do this without you.  I need</p>
<p>;;;your help.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;I can't help.  I can't help anyone.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can</p>
<p>;;;get me out of here and then I'll</p>
<p>;;;get that rocket off you, and we'll</p>
<p>;;;make a break for Andy's house.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's</p>
<p>;;;the difference.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.</p>
<p>;;;You must not be thinking clearly.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;No, Woody, for the first time I am</p>
<p>;;;thinking clearly.</p>
<p>```(looking at himself)</p>
<p>;;;You were right all along.  I'm not</p>
<p>;;;a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A</p>
<p>;;;stupid little insignificant toy.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being</p>
<p>;;;a toy is a lot better than being a</p>
<p>;;;Space Ranger.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Yeah, right.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;No, it is.  Look, over in that</p>
<p>;;;house is a kid who thinks you are</p>
<p>;;;the greatest, and it's not because</p>
<p>;;;you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's</p>
<p>;;;because you're a TOY!  You are HIS</p>
<p>;;;toy.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;But why would Andy want me?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Why would Andy want you?!  Look at</p>
<p>;;;you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any</p>
<p>;;;other toy would give up his moving</p>
<p>;;;parts just to be you.  You've got</p>
<p>;;;wings, you glow in the dark, you</p>
<p>;;;talk, your helmet does that -- that</p>
<p>;;;whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.</p>

<p>Woody pauses and looks at himself.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(continued; depressed)</p>
<p>;;;As a matter of fact you're too cool.</p>
<p>;;;I mean -- I mean what chance does a</p>
<p>;;;toy like me have against a Buzz</p>
<p>;;;Lightyear action figure?  All I can</p>
<p>;;;do is...</p>

<p>Woody pulls his own pull-string.</p>

<p>___WOODY (VOICE BOX)</p>
<p>;;;There's a snake in my boots!</p>

<p>Woody bows his head.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Why would Andy ever want to play</p>
<p>;;;with me, when he's got you?</p>
<p>```(pause)</p>
<p>;;;I'm the one that should be strapped</p>
<p>;;;to that rocket.</p>

<p>Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz.</p>

<p>Buzz lifts up his foot.</p>

<p>ANGLE: THE SOLE OF BUZZ'S FOOT</p>

<p>The signature "ANDY" reads through the dirt and scuff marks.</p>

<p>Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads</p>
<p>across his face.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You</p>
<p>;;;should get out of here while you can.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Woody turns around.</p>

<p>Buzz is gone.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks</p>
<p>up to see...</p>

<p>BUZZ</p>

<p>He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I</p>
<p>;;;thought you were --</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid</p>
<p>;;;over in that house who needs us.</p>
<p>;;;Now let's get you out of this thing.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Yes Sir!</p>

<p>Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they</p>
<p>finally get it to move but it's slow progress.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(strained)</p>
<p>;;;Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!</p>

<p>SFX: TRUCK</p>

<p>The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.</p>

<p>ANGLE: OUT SID'S BEDROOM WINDOW</p>

<p>With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...</p>

<p>A MOVING TRUCK</p>

<p>can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Woody!  It's the moving van.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;We've got to get out of here...NOW.</p>

<p>Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.</p>

<p>Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox</p>
<p>begins to move.</p>

<p>Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool</p>
<p>chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the</p>
<p>desk.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;C'mon, Buzz.</p>

<p>Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.</p>
<p>Woody drops down to the floor below.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(loud whisper)</p>
<p>;;;Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!</p>

<p>Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox</p>
<p>(and milkcrate) farther out.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;...almost</p>
<p>```(GRUNT)</p>
<p>;;;...there</p>
<p>```(GRUNT)</p>
<p>;;;...</p>

<p>Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and</p>
<p>milkcrate topple towards him.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(nervous laugh)</p>

<p>The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.</p>

<p>Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who</p>
<p>stirs...</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>```(in his sleep)</p>
<p>;;;I wanna ride the pony...</p>

<p>Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers</p>
<p>over the edge of the workbench.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!</p>

<p>Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(punch-drunk)</p>
<p>;;;No, I'm fine...I'm okay...</p>

<p>SFX: ALARM CLOCK</p>

<p>It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the</p>
<p>toolbox and Buzz goes limp.</p>

<p>Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up.</p>

<p>___SID</p>
<p>;;;Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!</p>

<p>Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room.</p>

<p>___SID (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!</p>

<p>Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches</p>
<p>the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back</p>
<p>open Woody is confronted by...</p>

<p>SCUD</p>

<p>The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!</p>

<p>Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND</p>
<p>SCRATCHES at the door.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(out of breath; to himself)</p>
<p>;;;Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,</p>
<p>;;;think!</p>

<p>Woody looks across the room.</p>

<p>THE MUTANT TOYS</p>

<p>have appeared all around the room.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Guys!</p>

<p>The mutant toys all scatter and hide.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!</p>
<p>;;;Please!  There's a good toy down</p>
<p>;;;there and he's -- he's going to be</p>
<p>;;;blown to bits in a few minutes all</p>
<p>;;;because of me.  I've gotta save him!</p>
<p>```(pause)</p>
<p>;;;-- But I need your help.</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the</p>
<p>shadows from under the bed.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Please.  He's my friend.  He's the</p>
<p>;;;only one I've got.</p>

<p>Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's</p>
<p>metal bedpost.</p>

<p>The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around</p>
<p>Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(to Babyface)</p>
<p>;;;Thank you.</p>
<p>```(to the others)</p>
<p>;;;Okay.  I think I know what to do.</p>
<p>;;;We're going to have to break a few</p>
<p>;;;rules, but if it works, it'll help</p>
<p>;;;everybody.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM</p>

<p>THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches</p>
<p>onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat</p>
<p>in the other.</p>

<p>Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.</p>

<p>INT. SID'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out</p>
<p>of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;All right, listen up.  I need Pump</p>

<p>The mutants all give an affirmative nod.</p>

<p>;;;Okay, let's move!</p>

<p>The toys all break.</p>

<p>Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll</p>

<p>pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the</p>

<p>A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky</p>

<p>into the van.</p>

<p>Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.</p>

<p>Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but</p>
<p>Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.</p>

<p>Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before</p>
<p>realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover</p>
<p>Buzz stuck in the fence.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Just go!  I'll catch up!</p>

<p>Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.</p>

<p>The van begins pulling out of the driveway.</p>

<p>Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the</p>
<p>fence.</p>

<p>The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the</p>
<p>van driving off down the street.</p>

<p>Woody and Buzz turn around.</p>

<p>THE MOVING VAN</p>

<p>drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just</p>
<p>in time.</p>

<p>After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few</p>
<p>steps behind.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Come on!</p>

<p>ANGLE: SID'S FRONT PORCH</p>

<p>Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the</p>
<p>sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the</p>
<p>moving truck.</p>

<p>Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.</p>

<p>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET</p>

<p>Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few</p>
<p>paces.</p>

<p>A STRAP</p>

<p>dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it</p>
<p>and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.</p>

<p>Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;You can do it, Woody.</p>

<p>Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Whew, I made it!</p>

<p>Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.</p>
<p>Woody looks behind him to see...</p>

<p>The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.</p>

<p>;;;Hold on, Woody!</p>

<p>;;;I can't do it!  Take care of Andy</p>
<p>;;;for me!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!</p>

<p>Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs</p>
<p>Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go</p>
<p>of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his</p>
<p>face.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz!</p>

<p>The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and</p>
<p>Scud behind.</p>

<p>Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the</p>
<p>bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to</p>
<p>lift up the heavy door.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at</p>
<p>a traffic light.</p>

<p>Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking</p>
<p>Woody with it.</p>

<p>Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck</p>
<p>until he spots what he's looking for.</p>

<p>A PILE OF MOVING BOXES</p>

<p>with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon.</p>

<p>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET</p>

<p>Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a</p>
<p>parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to</p>
<p>get under it.</p>

<p>INT. BACK OF MOVING TRUCK</p>

<p>Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.</p>

<p>;;;Are we there already?</p>

<p>___SLINKY</p>

<p>Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin</p>
<p>rummaging through the next box.</p>

<p>Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN</p>
<p>CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Ah-hah!  There you are!!</p>

<p>Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Hey!  What's he doing?</p>

<p>Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;He's at it again!</p>

<p>INTERCUT - EXT. STREET/INT. REAR OF MOVING TRUCK</p>

<p>Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud</p>
<p>and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.</p>

<p>RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.</p>

<p>The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to</p>
<p>cross the intersection.</p>

<p>Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid</p>
<p>the angry mob of toys.</p>

<p>Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the</p>
<p>moving truck.</p>

<p>Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on</p>
<p>Buzz --</p>

<p>doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>```(spinning)</p>
<p>;;;Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!</p>

<p>Rocky throws Woody to the floor.</p>

<p>-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud</p>
<p>giving close chase.</p>

<p>Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Pig pile!!</p>

<p>-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off.</p>
<p>Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards.</p>

<p>ANGLE: TRAFFIC LIGHT</p>

<p>It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.</p>

<p>Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.</p>

<p>Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a</p>
<p>halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into</p>
<p>another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that</p>
<p>encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.</p>

<p>Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on</p>
<p>the other side.</p>

<p>The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car</p>
<p>that had passed over Woody earlier.</p>

<p>Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a</p>
<p>hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up</p>

<p>Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.</p>

<p>Woody &amp; Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down</p>
<p>right on top of them.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>

<p>The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.</p>

<p>The toys plummet.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(covering his eyes)</p>
<p>;;;Ah-h-h-h-h!!</p>

<p>Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward</p>
<p>again.  Woody takes a peek.</p>

<p>They're flying.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;This isn't flying.  This is</p>
<p>;;;falling -- with style!</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!</p>

<p>They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass</p>
<p>over it.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;We're not aiming for the truck!</p>

<p>ANGLE: FAMILY VAN</p>

<p>Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then</p>
<p>drop into the car.</p>

<p>INT. FAMILY VAN - CONTINUOUS</p>

<p>Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box</p>
<p>in the back seat right next to Andy.</p>

<p>Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the</p>
<p>box.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Hey!  Wow!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;What?  What is it?</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>```(picking up the toys)</p>
<p>;;;Woody!  Buzz!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Oh, great, you found them.  Where</p>
<p>;;;were they?</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Here!  In the car!</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;See?  Now, what did I tell you?</p>
<p>;;;Right where you left them.</p>

<p>Andy hugs both toys.</p>

<p>CLOSE UP - WOODY AND BUZZ</p>

<p>They give each other a knowing wink.</p>

<p>```DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>EXT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING - LIVING ROOM BAY</p>
<p>WINDOW</p>

<p>Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be</p>
<p>seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.</p>

<p>___ANDY</p>
<p>;;;Which one can I open first?</p>

<p>___MRS. DAVIS</p>
<p>;;;Let's let Molly open one.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S NEW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS TREE</p>

<p>One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...</p>

<p>THE SARGENT</p>

<p>The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his</p>
<p>binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.</p>

<p>INT. CHRISTMAS TREE</p>

<p>A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported</p>
<p>by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.</p>

<p>INT. ANDY'S NEW BEDROOM</p>

<p>The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.</p>
<p>It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.</p>

<p>___SARGENT (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(over the monitor)</p>
<p>;;;Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come</p>
<p>;;;in, Frankincense.</p>

<p>Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the</p>
<p>nightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>```(to the room)</p>
<p>;;;Hey, heads up everybody!  It's</p>
<p>;;;showtime.</p>

<p>Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a</p>
<p>typical office Christmas party.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>;;;Oh!  It's time!</p>

<p>The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.</p>

<p>Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to</p>
<p>reveal...</p>

<p>BO PEEP</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!</p>
<p>```(rubbing his neck)</p>
<p>;;;There's gotta be a less painful way</p>
<p>;;;to get my attention.</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;Merry Christmas, Sheriff.</p>

<p>She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched</p>
<p>on a shelf dangling mistletoe.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Say, isn't that mistletoe?</p>

<p>___BO PEEP</p>
<p>;;;Mm-hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him.</p>

<p>The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor</p>
<p>restless with "excitement" not fear.</p>

<p>___REX</p>
<p>```(to Slinky)</p>
<p>;;;Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,</p>
<p>;;;like a leaf-eater.  That way, I</p>
<p>;;;could play the, uh, dominant</p>
<p>;;;predator.  Ha ha ha!</p>

<p>Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>;;;Quiet everyone, quiet!</p>

<p>___SARGENT (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(over monitor)</p>
<p>;;;Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.</p>
<p>;;;Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.</p>
<p>;;;Potato Head.</p>

<p>___HAMM</p>
<p>;;;Way to go, Idaho!</p>

<p>All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.</p>

<ol>
<li> POTATO HEAD</li>
</ol>
<p>;;;Gee, I better shave.</p>

<p>Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.</p>

<p>Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now</p>
<p>covers Woody's face.</p>

<p>___SARGENT (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(over monitor)</p>
<p>;;;Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now</p>
<p>;;;opening his first present --</p>
<p>```(STATIC)</p>


<p>Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>;;;Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not</p>
<p>;;;worried, are you?</p>

<p>___SARGENT (O.S.)</p>
<p>```(over monitor)</p>
<p>;;;I can't quite make out --</p>
<p>```(STATIC)</p>

<p>___BUZZ</p>
<p>```(defensively)</p>
<p>;;;Me?  No, no, no, no...</p>
<p>```(beat)</p>
<p>;;;Are you?</p>

<p>___WOODY</p>
<p>```(laughing)</p>
<p>;;;Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly</p>
<p>;;;get that is worse than you?!</p>

<p>We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Oh, what is it?  What is it?</p>

<p>SFX: BARKING</p>

<p>___ANDY (O.S.)</p>
<p>;;;Wow!  A puppy!</p>

<p>We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and</p>
<p>Woody.</p>

<p>They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and</p>
<p>LAUGH WEAKLY.</p>
