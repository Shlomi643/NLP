<p>   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off</p>
<p>   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the</p>
<p>   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.</p>

<p>   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.</p>
<p>   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Bye!</p>

<p>   As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves</p>
<p>   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.</p>

<p>___HANS</p>
<p>;;;Oh no.</p>

<p>   The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down</p>
<p>   in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.</p>

<p>;;;Ooh, that's a rough business to be</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Okay, just tell me one thing; what</p>
<p>;;;was happening on the North</p>
<p>;;;Mountain? Did it seem magical?</p>

<p>   Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Yes! Now, back up while I deal with</p>

<p>   Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.</p>

<p>___OAKEN</p>
<p>;;;What did you call me?</p>


<p>   EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT</p>

<p>   Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!</p>

<p>   Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.</p>

<p>___OAKEN</p>
<p>;;;Bye bye.</p>

<p>   Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,</p>
<p>   canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.</p>

<p>   Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees</p>
<p>   something. He points to a dilapidated barn.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;But I did find us a place to sleep.</p>
<p>;;;And it's free.</p>


<p>   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT</p>

<p>   Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he</p>
<p>   squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.</p>

<p>___OAKEN</p>
<p>```(teddy bear)</p>

<p>   A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Umph.</p>

<p>   He sits up. Looks in the bag.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Look, I know how to stop this</p>

<p>   He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;We leave at dawn.... And you forgot</p>
<p>;;;the carrots for Sven.</p>

<p>   A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.</p>

<p>   She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,</p>
<p>   Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff</p>
<p>   has a bite, contemplating.</p>

<p>```SLAM CUT TO:</p>

<p>   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.</p>
<p>   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its</p>
<p>   light reflects off...EYES. Several.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF(CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Sven, go. Go!</p>

<p>   Sven takes off.</p>

<p>   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Wolves. What do we do?</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;I've got this. You just...don't</p>

<p>   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Who marries a man she just met?</p>

<p>   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;It's true love!</p>

<p>   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a</p>
<p>   wolf away.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>```(shocked)</p>
<p>;;;Whoa.</p>

<p>   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.</p>
<p>   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Christopher!</p>

<p>   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the</p>
<p>   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;It's Kristoff!</p>

<p>   A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;AH!</p>

<p>   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Duck!</p>

<p>   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The</p>
<p>   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;You almost set me on fire!</p>

<p>   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;But I didn't.</p>

<p>   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Get ready to jump, Sven!</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;You don't tell him what to do!</p>

<p>   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I do!</p>

<p>   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness</p>
<p>   from the sled.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Jump, Sven!</p>

<p>   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.</p>

<p>   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.</p>

<p>   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.</p>

<p>   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He</p>
<p>   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.</p>

<p>   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his</p>
<p>   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below</p>
<p>   and burst into flames.</p>

<p>   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Uh-oh. No, no, no.</p>

<p>   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.</p>

<p>;;;AH! NO, NO, NO!</p>

<p>   The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.</p>

<p>   Kristoff grabs on.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Pull, Sven! Pull!</p>

<p>   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.</p>
<p>   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.</p>

<p>   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at</p>
<p>   the burning sled.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and</p>

<p>   Kristoff groans.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;And I understand if you don't want</p>

<p>   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Of course I don't want to help her</p>
<p>;;;anymore. In fact, this whole thing</p>

<p>   But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening</p>

<p>;;;NO!</p>

<p>___ANNA (O.S.)</p>

<p>   Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.</p>

<p>___ELSA</p>

<p>   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and</p>
<p>   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.</p>

<p>   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in</p>
<p>   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.</p>

<p>   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff</p>
<p>   rush into the room to Anna's side.</p>

<p>   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows</p>
<p>   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Anna, I think we should go.</p>

<p>   Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Olaf!</p>

<p>___OLAF</p>
<p>;;;Watch out for my butt!</p>

<p>   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the</p>
<p>   snowbank.</p>

<p>   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.</p>

<p>   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;It is not nice to throw people!</p>

<p>   Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Let me at him. I want to get</p>
<p>;;;him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.</p>

<p>   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and</p>
<p>   throws it at Marshmallow.</p>

<p>   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even</p>
<p>   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He</p>
<p>   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!</p>

<p>___OLAF</p>
<p>;;;...I'll distract him. You guys go.</p>

<p>   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite</p>
<p>   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.</p>

<p>___OLAF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;No, no, not you guys.</p>
<p>```73</p>

<p>   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's</p>
<p>   head falls and lands face down in snow.</p>

<p>___OLAF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(muffled)</p>
<p>;;;This just got a whole lot harder.</p>

<p>   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They</p>
<p>   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard</p>
<p>   right behind them.</p>

<p>   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under</p>
<p>   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;This way!</p>

<p>   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of</p>
<p>   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>```(impressed)</p>
<p>;;;Ho-ho-ho!</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost</p>
<p>   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Whoa, stop!</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;It's a hundred foot drop.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;It's two hundred.</p>

<p>   Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Ow.</p>

<p>   He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the</p>
<p>   snow with a pick axe.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;What's that for?</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>

<p>   A huge tree flies through the air toward them.</p>

<p>___ANNA (O.S.)</p>

<p>   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They</p>
<p>   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches</p>
<p>   their fall.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Whoa! That happened.</p>

<p>   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete</p>

<p>;;;Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.</p>

<p>;;;Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost</p>

<p>```(happily)</p>
<p>;;;Hey. We were just talking about</p>

<p>___OLAF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;NO!</p>

<p>   Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not</p>
<p>   making much of a difference.</p>

<p>___OLAF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;This is not making much of a</p>

<p>   Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.</p>

<p>   Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>

<p>   Kristoff's head hits the cliff.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>

<p>   Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>```(grossed out by his snow</p>

<p>   SLAM!</p>

<p>   REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her</p>
<p>   shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;Hey, you were right. Just like a</p>

<p>   She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's</p>

<p>```(bad acting)</p>
<p>;;;Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a</p>
<p>;;;doctor I could...No? And I demand</p>
<p>;;;to see the Queen!</p>

<p>   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.</p>

<p>___KAI</p>
<p>;;;I have a message from the Queen.</p>
<p>```(reading a scroll)</p>
<p>;;;Arendelle will henceforth and</p>
<p>;;;forever no longer do business of</p>
<p>;;;any sort with Weaseltown.</p>

<p>___DUKE</p>
<p>;;;Weselton. It's Weselton!</p>

<p>   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.</p>


<p>   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY</p>

<p>   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff</p>
<p>   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!</p>

<p>   She runs him right into a pole.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Pole.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Oops. Sorry.</p>


<p>   EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY</p>

<p>   Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>```(stopping)</p>
<p>;;;Okay. Okay. Here we are.</p>
<p>```110</p>
<p>FROZEN - J. Lee</p>



<p>   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before</p>
<p>   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in</p>
<p>   front of it -- Vanna White-style.</p>

<p>___ANNA (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I owe you a sled.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>```(blown away)</p>
<p>;;;Are you serious?</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Yes. And it's the latest model.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;No. I can't accept this...</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;You have to. No returns. No</p>
<p>;;;exchanges. Queen's orders. She's</p>
<p>;;;named you the official Arendelle</p>
<p>;;;Ice Master and Deliverer.</p>

<p>   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's</p>
<p>   king of the bucks.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;What? That's not a thing.</p>

<p>   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;Sure it is. And it even has a cup</p>
<p>;;;holder.... Do you like it?</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Like it?</p>

<p>   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;I love it.... I could kiss you!</p>

<p>   He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF (CONT'D)</p>
<p>;;;...I could. I mean I'd like to.</p>
<p>;;;I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may</p>
<p>;;;we? Wait, what?</p>

<p>   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;We may.</p>
<p>```111</p>
<p>FROZEN - J. Lee</p>



<p>   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.</p>

<p>   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.</p>

<p>   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the</p>
<p>   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.</p>

<p>   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks</p>
<p>   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.</p>

<p>   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the</p>
<p>   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it</p>
<p>   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf</p>
<p>   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.</p>

<p>```CUT TO:</p>


<p>   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY</p>

<p>   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,</p>
<p>   stands Elsa.</p>

<p>___ELSA</p>
<p>;;;Are you ready?</p>

<p>   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The</p>
<p>   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.</p>

<p>   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds</p>
<p>   some snow flurries for atmosphere.</p>

<p>   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;I like the open gates.</p>

<p>___ELSA</p>
<p>;;;We are never closing them again.</p>

<p>   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally</p>
<p>   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.</p>

<p>___ANNA</p>
<p>;;;What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,</p>
<p>;;;but you know I don't ska--</p>

<p>   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna</p>
<p>   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.</p>

<p>   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.</p>

<p>___KRISTOFF</p>
<p>;;;Look out. Reindeer coming through!</p>
<p>```112</p>
<p>FROZEN - J. Lee</p>



<p>   Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.</p>

<p>___OLAF</p>
<p>;;;That's it. Glide and pivot and</p>
<p>;;;glide and pivot.</p>

<p>   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye</p>
<p>   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been</p>
<p>   repaired with a ice.</p>

<p>   All is right in Arendelle.</p>
