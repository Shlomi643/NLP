   We're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,
   heading right for us.


<strong>   EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
   frozen lake. They SING.

</strong><strong>                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
</strong>                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
   fight it back.

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
   block of ice out of the water.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
   snowline...and descend upon...


<strong>   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT
</strong>
   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


<strong>   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT
</strong>
   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

<strong>                            YOUNG ELSA
</strong>                      (grumbling)
                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                      (drama queen-ish)
                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so
                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

<strong>                            YOUNG ELSA
</strong>                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                      (mischievously)
                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


<strong>   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT
</strong>
   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


<strong>   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
</strong>
   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  This is amazing!

<strong>                            YOUNG ELSA
</strong>                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.

<strong>   PLAY MONTAGE:
</strong>
   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

</strong>                      (goofy voice)
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

<strong>                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

<strong>                              YOUNG ELSA
</strong>                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

<strong>                            YOUNG ANNA
</strong>                      (jumping faster)
                  Again! Again!

<strong>                             YOUNG ELSA
</strong>                      (struggling to keep up)
                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

<strong>                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  ANNA!
</strong>
   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

<strong>                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
   of the room.

</strong>                  Elsa, what have you done? This is

                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,

<strong>   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
</strong>
   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
   to a page with an ancient map.


<strong>   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT
</strong>
   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
   trail of ice behind them.


<strong>   EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT
</strong>
   A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
   woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
   girls, leaving the wake of ice.

<strong>                            YOUNG KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Faster, Sven!


<strong>   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT
</strong>
   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
   the still unconscious Anna.

<strong>                            KING
</strong>                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
   unfold, revealing bright faces.

<strong>                               YOUNG KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

<strong>                            BULDA
</strong>                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

</strong>                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

<strong>                            GRAND PABBIE

   does. He examines her.

                  You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
                  The heart is not so easily changed,
                  but the head can be persuaded.

                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll
                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
   her head.

</strong>                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

<strong>                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
</strong>                  There is beauty in your magic....
                  But also great danger.

   -INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for
   two in the hall by standing on the back seat.

   -INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait
   room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

</strong><strong>                  I'VE STARTED TALKING TO

   Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the
   painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

</strong><strong>                  ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

   But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather
   clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

<strong>                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

   Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.
   The entire wall is frozen behind her.

   The King goes to hug her.

   He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

   -EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

   -EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in
   a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

   -INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is
   covered in mourning cloth.

   -EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her
   people, beside burial stones.

<strong>   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING
</strong>
   A new dawn rises over the fjords.

   Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

<strong>                            DOCK MASTER
</strong>                  Welcome to Arendelle!

   A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
   his bunad jacket.

<strong>                            BOY
</strong>                  Why do I have to wear this?

<strong>                            MOTHER
</strong>                  Because the Queen has come of age.
                  It's Coronation Day!

<strong>                            BOY
</strong>                  That's not my fault.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  What do you want, Sven?

   Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Give me a snack.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  What's the magic word?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Please!

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
   to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Hey, hey, hey! Share!

   Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
   not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

   We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
   rush towards the castle.

<strong>                            AGGIE
</strong>                  And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

   They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
   shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
   behind him.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
                  trade partner. Open those gates so
                  I may unlock your secrets and
                  exploit your riches.
                      (catching himself)
                  ...Did I just say that out loud?

   We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
   gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

<strong>                            IRISHMAN
</strong>                  Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
                  the Queen and the Princess. I bet
                  they're absolutely lovely.

<strong>                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
</strong>                  I bet they are beautiful.

   We move past them, to a particular castle window.

   -Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.

   -Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

<strong>                               ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                         (frustrated)

</strong>                  I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

   The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (gentler)
                  Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

<strong>                            HANS

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
                  was going. But I'm okay.

   He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Oh, thank goodness.

   He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
   her to her feet.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Princess...? My Lady.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Hi...again.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Oh boy.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
                  awkward, but just because we're--
                  I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
                      (did she just say that?)
                  Wait, what?

   Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  I'd like to formally apologize for

<strong>                              HANS
</strong>                  Just you?

   Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
   doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
   handsomeness.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I
                  better go. I have to...I better go.

   She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

<strong>                              ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Bye!

   As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves
   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

<strong>                              HANS
</strong>                  Oh no.

   The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down
   in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.

<strong>   INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY
</strong>
   Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She
   peeks out to the audience.

   Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.

   The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are
   presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.

<strong>                            BISHOP
</strong>                      (a whisper)
                  Your Majesty, the gloves.

   Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,
   places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb
   and scepter, then turns to the people.

<strong>                            BISHOP (CONT'D)

   The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

<strong>                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

<strong>                            CROWD
</strong>                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back
   down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks
   up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.

                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She
   stands under a formal awning.

<strong>                            KAI (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Princess Anna of Arendelle!

   Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over
   to stand right next to Elsa.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Here? Are you sure?

   She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.

   They look out at the celebration.

<strong>                            ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  So, this is what a party looks

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  And what is that amazing smell?

   They both close their eyes and inhale.

<strong>                            ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)
</strong>                  ...Chocolate.

   Their eyes pop open. They laugh.

   Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She
   wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.
   Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.

<strong>                            KAI
</strong>                  Your Majesty. The Duke of

                  fitting that I offer you your first
                  dance as queen.

   The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and
   a deep bow.

                  One, two, three. Jump.

   As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.
   Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.

   The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can
   protest.

</strong>                  If you swoon, let me know, I'll

</strong>                  Sorry.

   OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just
   awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.

   He lands on her feet.

                  in the first place? Do you know the
                  reason? Hmm?

   He gets in her face, suspicious.

   He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely
   hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.

   Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Excuse me for a minute.

   She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.

   Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's
   butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches
   her. He smiles perfectly.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Glad I caught you.

<strong>                               ANNA

   He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts
   her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

   Elsa bursts out of the castle door. The CITIZENS CHEER!

<strong>                            CROWD
</strong>                  There she is. Your Majesty! Long
                  live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come
                  drink with us.

   Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand.

<strong>                            BOWING TOWNSMAN
</strong>                  Queen Elsa.

<strong>                            TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY
</strong>                  Your Majesty? Are you all right?

   Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,
   grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.

   GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

   The Duke and thugs come out the door.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  There she is! Stop her!

<strong>                             ELSA

                  Please, just stay away from me.
                  Stay away!

   Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the
   staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.

<strong>                            DUKE

   The crowd panics.

   A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.

   Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa!

   Hans follows closely behind her.

   GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to
   the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.

   Anna calls to her from the gates.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Elsa! Wait, please!

   Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
   steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
   into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Elsa, stop!

   Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Anna!

   Hans rushes to Anna's side.

   Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just
   scrambles into the mountains.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  No.

</strong>                      (shocked)
                  Look.... The fjord.

   The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking
   the ships in place.


<strong>   INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT

   Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.

   Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

   Anna rushes up to the Duke.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Wait, no!

   The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.

</strong>                  It was an accident. She was scared.
                  She didn't mean it. She didn't mean

   The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.

<strong>                            HANS

   She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.

   The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a
   blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...


<strong>   EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest
   peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches
   her breath and sings...

   In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on

   A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna
   goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.
   Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.

   conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
   snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has
                  another young woman, the Queen
                  perhaps, I don't know, passed
                  through here?

   She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                  Only one crazy enough to be out in
                  this storm is you, dear?

   The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a
   man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.

<strong>                            OAKEN (CONT'D)
</strong>                  You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.
                  Big summer blow out.

   Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (in her face)
                  Carrots.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Huh?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Behind you.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Oh, right. Excuse me.

   Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of
   carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the
   place, gathering other supplies.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                      (to Kristoff)
                  A real howler in July, yah? Where

                  North Mountain.

   Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on
   his fingertips.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                  That'll be forty.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Forty? No, ten.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                      (sweet as pie)
                  Oh dear, that's no good. See these
                  are from our winter stock, where
                  supply and demand have a big
                  problem.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  You want to talk about a supply and
                  demand problem? I sell ice for a
                  living.

   Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of
   ice on his sled, covered in snow.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Ooh, that's a rough business to be
                  in right now. I mean, that is

                      (he shoots her a look)
                  Ahem. That's unfortunate.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                  Still forty. But I will throw in a
                  visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!
                  Hi, family.

   Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through
   the window of the steaming sauna.

<strong>                             NAKED FAMILY

   Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Okay, just tell me one thing; what
                  was happening on the North
                  Mountain? Did it seem magical?

   Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Yes! Now, back up while I deal with
                  this crook here.

   Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                  What did you call me?


<strong>   EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT
</strong>
   Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

   Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

<strong>                             OAKEN
</strong>                  Bye bye.

   Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,
   canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

   Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees
   something. He points to a dilapidated barn.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  But I did find us a place to sleep.
                  And it's free.


<strong>   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT
</strong>
   Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he
   squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.

<strong>                            OAKEN
</strong>                      (teddy bear)
                  I'm sorry about this violence. I
                  will add a quart of lutefisk, so
                  we'll have good feelings. Just the

   Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.

<strong>   INT. OAKEN'S STABLES - NIGHT
</strong>
   Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his
   lute and singing to (and for) Sven.

                    "Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong><strong>                  REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.

<strong>                  BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN
</strong><strong>                  REINDEERS.
</strong><strong>                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?
</strong>
                      (As Sven)
<strong>                  THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
</strong><strong>                  FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.

   The door opens. Anna enters.

<strong>                               ANNA
</strong>                  Nice duet.

   Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Oh, it's just you. What do you

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  I don't take people places.

   He lays back down, closes his eyes.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Let me rephrase that...

   A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Umph.

   He sits up. Looks in the bag.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Take me up the North Mountain....
                  Please.

   He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Look, I know how to stop this
                  winter.

   He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  We leave at dawn.... And you forgot
                  the carrots for Sven.

   A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Ugh!

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I
                  didn't--
                      (catching herself)
                  We leave now. Right now.

   She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,
   Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff
   has a bite, contemplating.

<strong>   EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT

   Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,
   which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits
   beside him.

</strong>                      (fearless)
                  I like fast!

   Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

   He pushes her feet down.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,
                  were you raised in a barn?

   Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back
   and hits Anna in the face.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (grossed out)

                  got engaged but then she freaked
                  out because I'd only just met him,
                  you know, that day. And she said
                  she wouldn't bless the marriage--

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Wait. You got engaged to someone

                  got mad and then she tried to walk
                  away, and I grabbed her glove--

                  is she wore the gloves all the
                  time, so I just thought, maybe she
                  has a thing about dirt.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Didn't your parents ever warn you
                  about strangers?

   Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

</strong>                  No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

   Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  I mean it. SHHH.

   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
   light reflects off...EYES. Several.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
</strong>                  Sven, go. Go!

   Sven takes off.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Wolves.

   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
   the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Wolves. What do we do?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  I've got this. You just...don't
                  fall off and don't get eaten.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  But I wanna help.

<strong>                             KRISTOFF
</strong>                  No.

<strong>                             ANNA
</strong>                  Why not?

<strong>                             KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Because I don't trust your
                  judgement.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Excuse me?!

   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Who marries a man she just met?

   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  It's true love!

   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
   wolf away.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (shocked)
                  Whoa.

   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Christopher!

   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  It's Kristoff!

   A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  AH!
</strong>
   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Duck!

   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  You almost set me on fire!

   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  But I didn't.

   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Get ready to jump, Sven!

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  You don't tell him what to do!

   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  I do!

   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
   from the sled.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Jump, Sven!

   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
   and burst into flames.

</strong>                      (shocked sadness)
                  ...But I just paid it off.

   Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Uh-oh. No, no, no.

   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  AH! NO, NO, NO!
</strong>
   The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.

<strong>                             ANNA (O.S.)
</strong>                  Grab on!

   Kristoff grabs on.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Pull, Sven! Pull!

   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
   the burning sled.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and
                  everything in it.

   Kristoff groans.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  And I understand if you don't want
                  to help me anymore.

   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Of course I don't want to help her
                  anymore. In fact, this whole thing
                  has ruined me for helping anyone
                  ever again.

</strong>                  But she'll die on her own.

   Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong
   way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
</strong>                  But you won't get your new sled if
                  she's dead.

                  ...You know sometimes I really
                  don't like you.

   Sven licks Kristoff happily.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF

   He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

<strong>   INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
   hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
   them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

<strong>                             ANNA
</strong>                  I never knew winter could be so
                  beautiful.

   Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
   voice OLAF.

<strong>                            OLAF (O.S.)
</strong>                  YEAH...It really is beautiful,
                  isn't it? But it's so white. You
                  know, how about a little color?
                  Must we bleach the joy out of it
                  all? I'm thinking like maybe some
                  crimson, chartreuse...

   While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
   source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
   be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
   branches, just as baffled as they are.

   In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
   them.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
                  Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

   He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.
   How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)

   Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,
   sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.

<strong>                              OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                        (cheery, to Kristoff)

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  You're creepy.

   Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a
   game of hot potato.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  I don't want it!

<strong>                            KRISTOFF

<strong>                              ANNA

   Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.

<strong>                            OLAF (O.S.)
</strong>                  All right, we got off to a bad

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Ew, ew, the body!

   Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf
   smiles happily, then looks confused.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Wait, what am I looking at right

   She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Well, almost.

   She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
   Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
   way through his head.

<strong>                            OLAF

                  just.... Are you okay?

   Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
   eyes. He lights up.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
                  I've always wanted a nose.
                      (going cross-eyed to look
                       at his tiny nose)
                  So cute. It's like a little baby
                  unicorn.

   Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
   out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  What? Hey! Whoa.
                      (seeing his now big nose)
                  Oh, I love it even more! Hah....
                  All right, let's start this thing
                  over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
                  like warm hugs.

   Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
   takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

   Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

</strong>                  Yeah. Why?

   Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies
   it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.

<strong>                            ANNA

                  Oh, I don't know why but I've
                  always loved the idea of summer,
                  and sun, and all things hot.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Really? I'm guessing you don't have

<strong>                            OLAF

<strong>   EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY
</strong>
   A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around
   weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and
   guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.

<strong>                            CITIZEN ONE
</strong>                  No. No. You've got the bark facing

   Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

<strong>                            GERDA

</strong>                  The castle is open. There's soup
                  and hot gl&ouml;gg in the Great Hall.

   He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

<strong>                            HANS (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Here. Pass these out.

   Just then the Duke approaches Hans.

<strong>                            DUKE

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  And that's another thing; has it
                  dawned on you that your princess
                  may be conspiring with a wicked
                  sorceress to destroy us all?

   Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Do not question the Princess. She
                  left me in charge, and I will not
                  hesitate to protect Arendelle from
                  treason.

                  Treason?!

   Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It
   returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.

<strong>                            HANS

                  happened to her? Where is she?

   Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees
   all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

   Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush
   up to offer their services.

   Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where
   he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He
   stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.

                  into the mountains want to be

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  You mean the love experts?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Yes, the love experts!

   Anna realizes she's stuck.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...Please tell me I'm almost there.

   REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...Does the air seem a bit thin to
                  you up here?

   Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.

<strong>                             KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Hang on.

   He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
   behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is
                  going to solve the problem, but I
                  found a staircase that leads
                  exactly where you want it to go.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

   Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Thanks! That was like a crazy trust
                  exercise.

   She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.
   Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.


<strong>   EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.

<strong>                             ANNA
</strong>                  Whoa.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (in awe)
                  Now that's ice. I might cry.
<strong>                                                              64

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Go ahead. I won't judge.

   Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His
   hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.
   Kristoff runs to his aide.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

   Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  You stay right here, buddy.

   Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his
   tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...Flawless.

   Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  ...Knock....
                      (she doesn't)
                  Just knock....
                      (she doesn't. To Kristoff)
                  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you
                  think she knows how to knock?

   Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors
   slide open.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Ha. It opened. That's a first.

   Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,
   stops him.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  You should probably wait out here.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  What?

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Last time I introduced her to a
                  guy, she froze everything.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice
                  is my life.

<strong>                               OLAF
</strong>                  Bye, Sven.

   Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  You too, Olaf.

<strong>                               OLAF

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Just give us a minute.

<strong>                               OLAF
</strong>                  Okay.

   As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  One...two...

   Kristoff joins in.

<strong>                            OLAF AND KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Three...four...


<strong>   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but
   also eerie.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

   Anna slips. Steadies herself.

<strong>                               ELSA (O.S.)
</strong>                  Anna.

   Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,
   looks to her longingly.

   Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa, you look different.... It's a
                  good different.... And this place
                  is amazing.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (cautious, polite)
                  Thank you, I never knew what I was
                  capable of.

   Anna starts to climb the stairs.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...I'm so sorry about what
                  happened. If I'd known--

   Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (on guard)
                  No, it's okay. You don't have to
                  apologize.... But you should
                  probably go, please.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  But I just got here.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  ...You belong in Arendelle.

<strong>                               ANNA
</strong>                  So do you.

   Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  No, I belong here. Alone. Where I
                  can be who I am without hurting
                  anybody.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...Actually, about that--

<strong>                            OLAF (O.S.)
</strong><strong>                  58...59...60.
</strong>
<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  Wait. What is that?

   Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

</strong>                      (shocked)
                  Olaf?

   Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
<strong>                                                                   67

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (bashful)
                  You built me. You remember that?

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (astonished)
                  And you're alive?

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Um...I think so?

   Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  He's just like the one we built as
                  kids.... We were so close. We can
                  be like that again.

   Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.

<strong>                            YOUNG ELSA

   Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  No, we can't.

   Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.

<strong>                            ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Goodbye, Anna.

</strong>                  You don't have to protect me. I'm

</strong><strong>                  AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...
</strong>
   Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

<strong>                             ELSA
</strong><strong>                  I CAN'T!
</strong>
   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
   rush into the room to Anna's side.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Anna. Are you okay?
<strong>                                                                   71

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  I'm okay.... I'm fine.

   Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (scared)
                  Who's this? Wait, it doesn't
                  matter. You have to go.

<strong>                             ANNA
</strong>                  No, I know we can figure this out
                  together--

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (desperate)
                  How? What power do you have to stop
                  this winter? To stop me?

   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Anna, I think we should go.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (close to tears)
                  No. I'm not leaving without you,
                  Elsa.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (heartbroken but decisive)
                  Yes, you are.

   Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
   We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

<strong>                                                        SLAM CUT TO:
</strong>

<strong>   EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY
</strong>
   Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
   necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Stop. Put us down!

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (to Marshmallow)
                  You are a lot stronger than I think
                  you realize.

   Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
<strong>                                                                    72

<strong>                            MARSHMALLOW
</strong>                      (like a bouncer)
                  Go away!

   Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck
   to the ice railing.

<strong>                              OLAF (O.S.)
</strong>                  Heads up!

   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Olaf!

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Watch out for my butt!

   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
   snowbank.

   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  It is not nice to throw people!

   Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.

<strong>              KRISTOFF                                   ANNA
</strong>   All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get
   down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.
   man be.

   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
   throws it at Marshmallow.

   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  ...I'll distract him. You guys go.

   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  No, no, not you guys.
<strong>                                                               73

   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's
   head falls and lands face down in snow.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                      (muffled)
                  This just got a whole lot harder.

   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
   right behind them.

   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

<strong>                               KRISTOFF
</strong>                  This way!

   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                      (impressed)
                  Ho-ho-ho!

<strong>                               ANNA
</strong>                  I got him!

   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Whoa, stop!

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  It's a hundred foot drop.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  It's two hundred.

   Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

<strong>                               ANNA
</strong>                  Ow.

   He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
   snow with a pick axe.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  What's that for?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  I'm digging a snow anchor.
<strong>                                                            74

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (not trusting)
                  Okay. What if we fall?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  There's twenty feet of fresh powder
                  down there; it'll be like landing
                  on a pillow.... Hopefully.

   They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Okay, Anna. On three.

   Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Okay. You tell me when...

<strong>                               KRISTOFF
</strong>                  One...

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...I'm ready to go....

<strong>                               KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Two...

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (pumped up)
                  ...I was BORN ready! Yes!

<strong>                               KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Calm down.

   A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

<strong>                               ANNA (O.S.)
</strong><strong>                  TREE!
</strong>
   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
   their fall.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Whoa! That happened.

   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete
   mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs
   and puffs, struggling to run.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
<strong>                                                               75

   He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!
                  Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost
                  Marshmallow back there!

   Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                      (happily)
                  Hey. We were just talking about
                  you. All good things, all good
                  things.

   Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.

<strong>                              OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  NO!
</strong>
   Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not
   making much of a difference.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  This is not making much of a
                  difference!

   Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.

<strong>                              OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong><strong>                  WHOA!
</strong>
   Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Olaf!

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Hang in there, guys!

   Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Wait, what?

   Kristoff's head hits the cliff.

<strong>                              KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Aargghh!

   Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Kristoff!
<strong>                                                               76

   Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all
   over them.

<strong>                            MARSHMALLOW
</strong>                  Don't come back!

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (grossed out by his snow
                       breath)
                  Ugh. We won't.

   Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to
   just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

<strong>   SLAM!
</strong>
   REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
   shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Hey, you were right. Just like a
                  pillow.

   She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's
   boots, which are sticking out of the snow.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (shaking the boots)
                  I can't feel my legs! I can't feel
                  my legs!

   Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Those are my legs.

   Olaf's bottom goes running by.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (to Kristoff)
                  Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
                  butt.

   Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Oh, that feels better.

   Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.

<strong>                               OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Hey, Sven!

   Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off
   his nose -- and misses.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  He found us.
                      (to Sven, funny voice)
                  Who's my cute little reindeer?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Don't talk to him like that.

   Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.

<strong>                               KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Here.

   He lifts her out easily.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (impressed)
                  Whoa!

<strong>                               ANNA

   They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...Um.... How's your head?

   She touches the spot where he banged his head.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (in pain)
                  Ah! Ooh!

   He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.
                  Ha. I've got a thick skull.

<strong>                            OLAF

                  Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?
                  She threw me out. I can't go back
                  to Arendelle with the weather like
                  this. And then there's your ice

                      (noticing something)
                  Worry about your hair?!

   She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  What? I just fell off a cliff. You

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (thinking)
                  ...No.

   Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to
   join the conversation.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  You hesitated.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.
                  Now, come on.

   He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Okay! Where are we going?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  To see my friends.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (catching up)
                  The love experts?

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Love experts?!

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Yes. And don't worry; they'll be
                  able to fix this.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  How do you know?

   He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls
   heal her as a child.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  ...Because I've seen them do it
                  before.

   As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  I like to consider myself a love

<strong>   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY
</strong>
   Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (mantra-style)
                  Get it together. Control it. Don't
                  feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!

   She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a
   sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow
   up the wall, taking over the castle.

<strong>   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT
</strong>
   The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as
   he rides on Sven's back.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

   Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Are you cold?

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...A little.

   He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides
   against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,
   then gets a thought.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Wait. Come here.

   He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
   lined pass.

   Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.
   He holds her hands over one of them.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Oooh.... That's nice.

   They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (taking a deep breath)
                  So, about my friends...well, I say
                  friends, they're more like
                  family.... Anyway, when I was a
                  kid, it was just me and
                  Sven...until they took me in.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (moved)
                  They did?

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                      (nervous ramble)
                  Yeah. I don't want to scare you,
                  they can be a little bit
                  inappropriate...and loud...very
                  loud...they're also stubborn at
                  times, and a little overbearing.
                  And heavy. Really, really heavy.

</strong>                  But they're fine.. You'll get it.
                  They mean well.

   Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

   Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Okay then....

   Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave
   of the arms announces--

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Meet my family.

   REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.

</strong>                      (to the rocks)
                  Hey, guys!

   As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and
   greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (to herself)
                  ...They're rocks.

                  He's crazy.
                      (covertly, to Anna)
                  I'll distract them while you run.
                      (Loud and slow to a rock)
                  Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to
                  meet you!
                      (quietly to Anna)
                  Anna, because I love you, I insist
                  you run.

                      (to Anna)
                  Why aren't you running?

   Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

   Just then the rocks around her start rolling.

</strong>                      (panicking)

   Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff
   and unfold as trolls.

<strong>                            BULDA

</strong>                      (excitedly)
                  Kristoff's home.

   He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Wait? Kristoff?

   Anna watches, shocked and confused.

   The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him
   down with a boulder's strength.

<strong>                            TROLL ONE
</strong>                  Oh, lemme look at you!

   Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

</strong>                  Pick me up.

   The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks
   under the weight of him.

   Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Trolls? They're trolls.

   Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

   Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look
   at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.

<strong>                            BULDA

   Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly
   beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.

   During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each

   Sparks! Chemistry!

   Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's
   shivering something fierce.

   He pulls off her cape and hat.

   Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.
   Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the
   pit.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF

</strong>                  I can't. If it was her head, that
                  would be easy. But only an act of

<strong>                            ANNA

   A bunch of trolls give each other kisses.

   Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of
   her hair turns white.

   Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out.

   Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

</strong>                  We are here to find Princess Anna.
                  Be on guard, but no harm is to come
                  to the Queen. Do you understand?

   The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow
   rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's
   snow guard.

<strong>                               MARSHMALLOW
</strong>                  Go away!

   He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of
   the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,
   who quickly knocks them over.

   Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple
   over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but
   Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,
   leaps, and grabs it.

   Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

   The Duke's two thugs see her.

<strong>                               DUKE'S THUG

<strong>   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   They guards burst through the ice doors.

   Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.

   They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (scared)
                  No. Please.

   One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last
   moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches
   from her face.

   The thugs reposition to take another shot.

<strong>                               ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Stay away!

   Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and
   continue the attack.

<strong>                            THUG
</strong>                  Get her! Get her!

   Elsa fights for her life.

   BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
   away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
   Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
   back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
   before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

   REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and
   they rush into the ice palace.


<strong>   INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY
</strong>
   Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa
   traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.

   The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against
   the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.

   OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug
   is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his
   death.

   BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and
   the thugs near death.

   Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,
   moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,
   overwhelmed, frightened.

   The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice
   spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage
   and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.

   Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the
   arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
   directly above Elsa.

   The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.

   Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.

   All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the
   sound of it shattering as it rings out.

   Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.

   She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.


<strong>   INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY

   Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's
   pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.
   She's chained to the wall.

   Elsa strains to looks out a window...

   INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting
   further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.

</strong>                  You have to tell them to let me go.

   Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her
   shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.

   Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  What happened out there?

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa struck me with her powers.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  You said she'd never hurt you.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  I was wrong.

   Anna crumbles, weak.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Anna.

   Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (shivering more)
                  She froze my heart and only an act
                  of true love can save me.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                      (understanding)
                  A true love's kiss.

   He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile.
   He leans in slowly...gently...

   Then he stops.

<strong>                            HANS (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Oh, Anna. If only there was someone
                  out there who loved you.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  What?

   Hans gets up, leaving her there.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...You said you did.

   He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  As thirteenth in line in my own
                  kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I
                  knew I'd have to marry into the
                  throne somewhere--

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  What are you talking about?

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                      (putting out the candles)
                  As heir, Elsa was preferable, of
                  course. But no one was getting
                  anywhere with her. But you-

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Hans?

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  You were so desperate for love you
                  were willing to marry me, just like
                  that.

   Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table
   and goes to the fireplace.

<strong>                            HANS (CONT'D)
</strong>                  I figured, after we married, I'd
                  have to stage a little accident for
                  Elsa.

   Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.
   Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Hans. No, stop.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  But then she doomed herself, and
                  you were dumb enough to go after
                  her.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Please.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                      (chuckles)
                  All that's left now is to kill Elsa
                  and bring back summer.

   Hans approaches Anna.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  ...You're no match for Elsa.

   He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time
   not so gently.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on
                  the other hand, am the hero who is
                  going to save Arendelle from
                  destruction.

   She wrenches her face out of his hands.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (anger)
                  You won't get away with this.

   Hans rises and crosses to the door.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Oh, I already have.

   Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna
   struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (hoarse and weak)
                  Please, somebody help.

   The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the
   floor.

<strong>   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT

   The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He
   rubs his arms and shivers.

</strong>                  It's getting colder by the minute.
                  If we don't do something soon,
                  we'll all freeze to death.

   Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.

   Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  What happened to her?

<strong>                            HANS

                  At least we got to say our marriage
                  vows...before she died in my arms.

   He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  There can be no doubt now; Queen

   it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.

                  sentence her to death.


<strong>   INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY
</strong>
   The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is
   devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

</strong>                  She's dangerous. Move quickly and
                  with resolve.

   Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door
   busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men
   duck out of the way.

   Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...

   The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the
   floor. Elsa is gone.

<strong>   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY
</strong>
   Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not
   wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes
   his head. Enough.

   He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts
   and grunts.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  What is it, buddy?

   Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Hey, watch it. What's wrong with
                  you?

   Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                      (avoiding)

   Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
   lift Kristoff off the ground.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

   Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  No, Sven! We're not going back!

   Sven shakes his head, angrily.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  She's with her true love.

   Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
   he's made his point.

   Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
   kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
   castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Anna.

   Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
   runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
   jumps onto his back.

<strong>   INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

   Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking
   the ceiling.

   The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.

                  Help.

   CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
   hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
   on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Anna. Oh no.

   He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,
   including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,
   before striking a match and relighting the fire.

   fire.

</strong>                      (confused innocence)

   He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against
   hers and thinks.

                  Some people are worth melting for.

   But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow
   back in place.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Just maybe not right this second.

   Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut
   but struggles with the second panel.

   and sees...

                  Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I
                  guess Kristoff doesn't love you
                  enough to leave you behind.

   Anna tries to get to her feet.

<strong>                            ANNA

                  right there, riding across the
                  fjords like a valiant, pungent
                  reindeer king! Come on!

   The walls crack under the ice pressure.

<strong>                              OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Look out!

   They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.


<strong>   INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and
   block their path.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  We're trapped.

   Anna looks around desperately for a way out.

<strong>   EXT. FJORD -- DAY
</strong>
   Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.


<strong>   EXT. CASTLE -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it
   sweeps the window panes away.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Slide, Anna.

   It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?
   They slide down the iced-covered building.

   Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers
   snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant
   snowball.

<strong>                            OLAF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  We made it!

   He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.


<strong>   EXT. FJORD -- DAY
</strong>
   Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across
   the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the
   storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight
   through.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Come on, buddy, faster.



<strong>                                                     CUT TO:

   Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Kristoff!

   The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling
   off into the storm.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Keep going, Anna!

   Anna struggles on.
<strong>                                                              104

<strong>                                                       PAN TO:
</strong>
   Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven
   struggles over the uneven surface.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Come on! Come on!

   Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
   They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them
   and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire
   ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet.

   The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too
   wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing
   water and disappears below.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Sven? Sven!

   At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy
   water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a
   floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to
   go on.

<strong>                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Good boy.

   Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over
   an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running
   out of time.

   She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the
   inevitable is coming.

<strong>                                                       CUT TO:

   Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to
   turn. But then he hears a faint--

<strong>                              ANNA (O.S.)
</strong>                  Kristoff.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Anna...? Anna!

   Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is
   consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Elsa. You can't run from this!

   Elsa backs away from him.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  ...Just take care of my sister.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Your sister? She returned from the
                  mountain weak and cold. She said
                  you froze her heart.

<strong>                              ELSA
</strong>                  What? No.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  I tried to save her, but it was too
                  late. Her skin was ice. Her hair
                  turned white...

   Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.

<strong>                            HANS (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Your sister is dead... because of
                  you.

   Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,
   the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,
   hangs suspended, trapped in grief.

   Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out
   to see...

   Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the
   fjords to...

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                      (a whisper)
                  Kristoff.

<strong>                              KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Anna.

   Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards
   her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is
   giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.

   But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from
   its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he
   raises his sword over his head.
<strong>                                                           106

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa.

   Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him
   a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

   Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword
   down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.

<strong>                              ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  No!

   In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits
   her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force
   of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.

<strong>                              ELSA
</strong>                  Anna!

   Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.

<strong>                            ELSA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

   Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (confused, sad)
                  Anna?

   Elsa hugs Anna and cries.

   Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his
   side.

   Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.

   All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.

   But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.

   Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

   Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  Wha-? Anna?

   Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.

<strong>                              ANNA
</strong>                  Oh, Elsa.

   They embrace.
<strong>                                                              107

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  ...You sacrificed yourself for me?

<strong>                             ANNA
</strong>                      (weak)
                  ...I love you.

   Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
   lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  An act of true love will thaw a
                  frozen heart.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                      (processing)
                  Love...will thaw...
                      (realizing)
                  Love.... Of course.

   Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Elsa?

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  Love.

   Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
   ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

   Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

   The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

   The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

   In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
   snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
   summer day.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  I knew you could do it.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                      (melting, good-naturedly)
                  Hands down, this is the best day of
                  my life...and quite possibly the
                  last.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
<strong>                                                                  108

   Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
   air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
   perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  Hey, my own personal flurry.

   Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
   toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
   stops him.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Uh. Uh. Uh.

   She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                      (confused)
                  Anna? But she froze your heart.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  The only frozen heart around here
                  is yours.

   She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
   satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

<strong>                            HANS
</strong>                  Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

   He falls overboard.

   Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
   Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

<strong>   EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

   It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
   repaired and are sailing away.

   On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

<strong>                            FRENCH DIGNITARY

                  behavior.

   Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
   thugs to their ship.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  This is unacceptable. I am
                  innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
                  I've been traumatized.
                      (bad acting)
                  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a
                  doctor I could...No? And I demand
                  to see the Queen!

   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

<strong>                            KAI
</strong>                  I have a message from the Queen.
                      (reading a scroll)
                  Arendelle will henceforth and
                  forever no longer do business of
                  any sort with Weaseltown.

<strong>                            DUKE
</strong>                  Weselton. It's Weselton!

   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.


<strong>   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY
</strong>
   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

   She runs him right into a pole.

   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
   front of it -- Vanna White-style.

<strong>                            ANNA (CONT'D)
</strong>                  I owe you a sled.

                  Are you serious?

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Yes. And it's the latest model.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  No. I can't accept this...

                  named you the official Arendelle
                  Ice Master and Deliverer.

   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
   king of the bucks.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  What? That's not a thing.

   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  Sure it is. And it even has a cup
                  holder.... Do you like it?

<strong>                             KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Like it?

   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  I love it.... I could kiss you!

   He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
</strong>                  ...I could. I mean I'd like to.
                  I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may
                  we? Wait, what?

   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
   stands Elsa.

   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
   some snow flurries for atmosphere.

   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  I like the open gates.

<strong>                            ELSA
</strong>                  We are never closing them again.

   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

<strong>                            ANNA
</strong>                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
                  but you know I don't ska--

   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

<strong>                            KRISTOFF
</strong>                  Look out. Reindeer coming through!
<strong>                                                                 112

   Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.

<strong>                            OLAF
</strong>                  That's it. Glide and pivot and
                  glide and pivot.

   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
   repaired with a ice.

   All is right in Arendelle.</pre>
