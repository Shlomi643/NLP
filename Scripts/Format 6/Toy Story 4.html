<p>The very next morning back home at the Davis family's house, Felix and Kathy are now 7 years old right now and not babies any longer.</p>
<p>Felix and Kathy are playing Go fish with their toy friends: Officer Sanders, Karate Samson, Bethany the Diva and Indiana Jack.</p>
<p>Hannah: (calling from downstairs) "Felix, Kathy, are you kids ready for school right now?"</p>
<p>Felix: (calling back from his and Kathy's bedroom) "Yeah, Mom, we sure are!"</p>
<p>Felix and Kathy go right downstairs and head on outside to catch the school bus and go all the way to David Bowie Memorial Elementary School to meet their new 1st grade teacher, Bernice Johnson.</p>
<p>Officer Sanders, Karate Samson, Bethany and Indiana Jack look around in Felix and Kathy's bedroom.</p>
<p>Officer Sanders: "Well, there they go."</p>
<p>Karate Samson: "Our very best owners off to school on their own."</p>
<p>Indiana Jack: "Now we'll just have plenty of time to have lots of fun and excitement right before they get back home right after lunch."</p>
<p>Bethany: "I just wonder how Woody, Buzz and the other toy friends are doing at home in Bonnie's bedroom.</p>
<p>Cut back to the Anderson family's house/back in Bonnie's bedroom again</p>
<p>Jingle Joe: "Well, you guys, Felix and Kathy are at school with Bonnie right now, so now we'll try not to put our lives on hold."</p>
<p>Rex: "Good thinking, Jingle Joe."</p>

<p>Bernice: "Good morning, students."</p>
<p>All 1st grade students: "Good morning, Miss Johnson."</p>

<p>Bernice; "Okay, students, it's time for me to check your macaroni artwork."</p>
<p>Bernice walks around and checks on their macaroni artwork.</p>
<p>Bernice: "Good, Bonnie, very good, I like your firefly picture."</p>
<p>Bonnie: "Thanks a bunch, Miss Johnson."</p>
<p>Bernice: "Mason, I really love your crocodile."</p>
<p>Mason: "Thanks, Miss Johnson, I appreciate it."</p>
<p>Bernice walks right over to Felix and Kathy's desks.</p>
<p>Bernice: "And what kind of macaroni art did you make, Felix and Kathy?"</p>
<p>Felix: "Kathy and I made a macaroni art picture of 2 lion cubs."</p>
<p>Kathy: "They're super adorable and thrilling."</p>
<p>Bernice: "That sounds very nice, now when the glitter glue is all dried up, you can all take it home with you."</p>
<p>[School Bell Ringing]</p>
<p>Bernice: "Well, there goes the school bell, have a good lunch, students.</p>
<p>Later, in the school cafeteria lunchroom, all of the students are enjoying their lunch meals in their lunch bags.</p>
<p>Felix: "What's black and white, black and white, black and white and blue all over?"</p>
<p>Mason: "I don't know, Felix."</p>
<p>Felix: "3 skunks fighting over a blue raspberry ice cream bar."</p>
<p>Kathy: [Giggles A Bit]</p>
<p>Bonnie: "That's a good 1, Felix, it's a real hilarious joke and riddle."</p>

<p>Bo Peep: "Hey, you guys, Bonnie's coming back upstairs!"</p>
<p>Woody: "Get back in your positions, everybody!"</p>
<p>Woody, Buzz and the toy friends get into their positions again.</p>
<p>Bonnie: [Continues Whistling Tunelessly]</p>
<p>Bonnie enters her bedroom again.</p>
<p>Bonnie: "Look, you guys, look at the macaroni artwork I made at school this morning, (she shows them the firefly picture that she made in Bernice Johnson's class.) it's a picture of a firefly, he's real nice looking."</p>
<p>Bonnie tapes the macaroni artwork on her bedroom wall.</p>
<p>Bonnie: "There, it'll be safe up here."</p>
<p>Bonnie goes back downstairs for dinner tonight again.</p>
<p>Slinky: "Golly bob howdy, that was a real close 1."</p>

<p>Professor Earth Dragonfly (off screen): [Evil Laughter]</p>
<p>Trixie: "Oh my word!"</p>
<p>Buttercup: "It's Professor Earth Dragonfly!"</p>
<p>Wheezy: "I thought he was sold to the Lucky Good Will Shop!"</p>
<p>Mr. Potato Head: "Well, he must've escaped real early this year."</p>
<p>Rex: "Oh dear, not Professor Earth Dragonfly!"</p>
<p>They all go right up to Bonnie's bedroom window.</p>
<p>Dolly: "What do you think he's doing this time?"</p>
<p>Woody: "Let me check what's going on out there."</p>
<p>Woody picks up Lenny for his assistance, and looks right through him to see what evil plan Professor Earth Dragonfly has come up with.</p>
<p>Woody: "Oh no, it's a zombie mind control device."</p>
<p>Mrs. Potato Head: "We'd better put a stop to this right before we end up like those mind controlled zombie victims out there."</p>
<p>Woody: "Bo Peep, you stay right here with Trixie, Mr. Pricklepants, Dolly, Buttercup, Chuckles, Mr. Robot, Mr. Snake, Mr. Shark, Etch, Mr. Spell and the Peas-In-A-Pod, me, Buzz, Slinky, Rex, Lenny, Wheezy, Hamm, Jingle Joe, the Potato Heads, the Green Army Men and the Green Aliens are heading out on our mission."</p>
<p>Bo Peep: "Roger that, Woody, I can always count on your assistance."</p>
<p>The 17 toy friends carefully slide right down the rope outta Bonnie's bedroom window and head on out to defeat Professor Earth Dragonfly.</p>
<p>Woody: "Alright, Professor Earth Dragonfly, the jig is up!"</p>
<p>Professor Earth Dragon Fly: "Well if it isn't Woody and Buzz and their pathetic little toy friends, now, it's time for me to turn Wheezy into a zombie mind control servant."</p>
<p>Buzz: "Oh, no, we're not falling for that 1!"</p>
<p>Professor Earth Dragon Fly uses his zombie mind control device on Wheezy, and turns him into a zombie mind control servant.</p>
<p>Wheezy: "Here I come, Petunia, here I come, Petunia."</p>
<p>Rex: "Oh dear, Wheezy's become a zombie mind control servant!"</p>
<p>Jessie: "We better snap him out of it!"</p>
<p>Wheezy: "Here I come, Petunia, here I come, Petunia."</p>
<p>Buzz: "Well, the only way to snap him outta this situation is to defeat Professor Earth Dragonfly."</p>
<p>Lenny: "How are we gonna do that?"</p>
<p>Woody: "We're gonna toss him over board and destroy the zombie mind control device."</p>
<p>Sarge: "We're on it, men, let's move, move, move!"</p>
<p>Other Green Army Men: "Sir, yes, sir!"</p>
<p>They all go over to approach Professor Earth Dragonfly, and pile on him.</p>
<p>Professor Earth Dragonfly: "No, stop, this isn't what it looks like!"</p>
<p>The zombie mind control device is now broken and Wheezy is finally free at last from the mind control waves.</p>
<p>Wheezy: "Where am I? what happened here?"</p>
<p>Woody: "Wheezy, you're back to your original self again."</p>
<p>Jessie: "Yee-haw, no more zombie mind control servant!"</p>
<p>Wheezy: "And no more Professor Earth Dragonfly, what a mean horrible nasty man, good thing he's outta this universe."</p>
<p>Buzz: "Well, you guys, let's go back home to Bonnie's bedroom."</p>
<p>The 17 toy friends walk around on their way home to Bonnie's bedroom, which they eventually make it up to her bedroom window.</p>

<p>Bonnie: (from downstairs in the living room) "Look, Brian, look at the dancing monkeys."</p>
<p>Buzz: "So, Woody, how do you think Bonnie is doing with her 3 month old brother?"</p>
<p>Woody: "Oh she's doing good, Buzz,she's been playing with him ever since she came back home from school that afternoon, but we'll always have our good friends to keep all of us company."</p>
