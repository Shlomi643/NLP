<p>THOMAS Captain John Smith! I've heard some amazing stories about him.</p>
<p>LON Are you coming on this voyage, too?</p>
<p>BEN Course he is, you half-wit. You can't fight Indians without John Smith.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH That's right. I'm not about to let you boys have all the fun.</p>
<p>ENGLISH CHORUS On the beaches of Virginny There's diamonds like debris There's silver rivers flow And gold you pick right off a tree With a nugget for my Winnie And another one for me And all the rest'll go To the Virginia Company It's glory, God and gold And the Virginia Company</p>

<p>LON Yes yes, yes. We would.</p>
<p>BEN Absolutely.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Trouble on deck?</p>
<p>THOMAS Governor Ratcliffe!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Thomas fell overboard, sir.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved. Well done, Smith.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long before we reach the New World, and remember what awaits us there: freedom&mdash;</p>
<p>PERCY [Bark.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Prosperity&mdash;</p>
<p>PERCY [Bark bark.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE The adventure of our lives. You are the finest crew England has to offer and nothing, not wind nor rain nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way. Carry on men!</p>
<p>ENGLISHMEN [Cheer.]</p>
<p>WIGGINS A stirring oration sir. I'm sure the men were most exhilarated.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Let us hope so. I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?</p>
<p>[Cut to: Elsewhere on deck.]</p>
<p>THOMAS This New World's going to be great, John. I'm going to get a pile of gold, build me a big house and if any Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH You just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas. Leave the savages to me.</p>
<p>LON You think they'll give us much trouble?</p>
<p>BEN Not as much trouble as Smith'll give them!</p>
<p>ENGLISHMEN We'll kill ourselves an Injun</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Or maybe two or three</p>
<p>ENGLISHMEN &amp; JOHN SMITH We're stalwart men and bold Of the Virginia Company</p>
<p>THOMAS What do you suppose the New World will look like?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Like all the others, I suppose. I've seen hundreds of New Worlds, Thomas. What could possibly be different about this one?</p>

<p>NATIVE AMERICANS [Cheer.]</p>
<p>KEKATA Your return has brought much joy to the village. Look at all the smiling faces.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Yes, but there is one smiling face I don't see. Where is my daughter?</p>
<p>KEKATA You know Pocahontas. She has her mother's spirit. She goes wherever the wind takes her.</p>
<p>[Transition to: Top of cliff.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas! Your father's back! Come down here!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS He's back, Flit! Come on, Meeko.</p>
<p>NAKOMA No, not that&hellip; way.</p>
<p>[Pocahontas dives into the river.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA Show-off. Pocahontas? Pocahontas? Are you all right? Well, you better be all right because I'm not coming in after you&hellip;! [Coughs.] Don't you think we're getting a little old for these games?</p>
<p>NAKOMA &amp; POCAHONTAS [Laugh.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Help me turn this thing over.</p>
<p>NAKOMA What were you doing up there?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Thinking. Meeko!</p>
<p>NAKOMA About the dream again? Oh, have you figured it out yet?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I know it means something, I just don't know what.</p>
<p>NAKOMA You should ask your father about it.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Maybe I should. Come on, Flit. Quit playing around, we have to get back.</p>
<p>[Transition to: The Powhatan Village.]</p>
<p>POWHATAN &hellip;faced a determined enemy. The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell. Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum. He attacked with the fierce strength of the bear. He has proven himself to be the greatest&hellip;</p>
<p>NAKOMA Oh, he's so handsome.</p>
<p>POWHATAN (off-screen) &hellip; and the finest&hellip;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I especially love his smile.</p>
<p>POWHATAN &hellip; destroying every enemy in his path. Tonight we will feast in his honor.</p>
<p>NATIVE AMERICANS [Cheer.]</p>
<p>POWHATAN My daughter.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Wingapo, father.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Seeing you gives me great joy.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I am so glad you've come home safely.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Come with me, we have much to talk about. I want to hear everything you've been doing.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Father, for many nights now I've been having a very strange dream. I think it's telling me something's about to happen, something exciting.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Yes, something exciting is about to happen.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Really, what is it?</p>
<p>POWHATAN Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Marry Kocoum?</p>
<p>POWHATAN I told him it would make my heart soar.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But he's so&hellip; serious.</p>
<p>POWHATAN My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband. He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls. With him you will be safe from harm.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.</p>
<p>POWHATAN This is the right path for you.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But why can't I choose&mdash;</p>
<p>POWHATAN Pocahontas, come with me. You are the daughter of the chief. It is time to take your place among our people. Even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river. As the river cuts his path Though the river's proud and strong He will choose the smoothest course That's why rivers live so long They're steady as the steady beating drum Your mother wore this for our wedding. It was her dream to see you wear it at your own. It suits you.</p>
<p>[Transition to: Pocahontas alone at the riverside.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS He wants me to be steady&hellip; Like the river. But it's not steady at all. What I love most about rivers is You can't step in the same river twice The water's always changing, always flowing But people, I guess, can't live like that We all must pay a price To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the riverbend Waiting just around the riverbend I look once more Just about the riverbend Beyond the shore Where the gulls fly free Don't know what for What I dream the day might send Just around the riverbend For me Coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees Or right behind these waterfalls Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome, sturdy husband Who builds handsome, sturdy walls And never dreams that something might be coming Just around the riverbend Just around the riverbend I look once more Just around the riverbend Beyond the shore Somewhere past the sea Don't know what for Why do all my dreams extend Just around the riverbend Just around the riverbend Should I choose the smoothest course? Steady as the beating drum Should I marry Kocoum? Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver Just around the riverbend?</p>
<p>[Transition to: Pocahontas arriving at Grandmother Willow's glen.]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Is that my Pocahontas?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Grandmother Willow, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Good morning, child. I was hoping you'd visit today. Why, your mother's necklace!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS That's what I wanted to talk to you about. My father wants me to marry Kocoum.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Kocoum? But he's so serious.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me. But lately I've been having this dream and I think it's&mdash;</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it!</p>
<p>ANIMALS [Chatter.]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Quiet! Quiet!</p>
<p>FROG [Ribbit.]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Now, child, you were saying.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Well, I'm running through the woods and then right there in front of me is an arrow. As I look at it, it starts to spin.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW A spinning arrow? How unusual.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Yes! It spins faster and faster and faster until suddenly it stops.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Hmm. Well, seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But Grandmother Willow, what is my path? How am I ever going to find it?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW [Chuckle.] Your mother asked me the very same question.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS She did? What did you tell her?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW I told her to listen. All around you are spirits, child. They live in the earth, the water, the sky. If you listen, they will guide you.</p>
<p>WIND SPIRITS Ay ay ay na ay ay na</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I hear the wind.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Yes, what is it telling you?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I don't understand.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Que que na-to-ra You will understand Listen with your heart You will understand Let it break upon you Like a wave upon the sand</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS It's saying something's coming! Strange clouds?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Listen with your heart You will understand</p>
<p>WIND SPIRITS You will understand</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW What do you see?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Clouds. Strange clouds.</p>
<p>[Cut to: The Susan Constant.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Look at it, Wiggins. An entire New World chock full of gold, just waiting for me.</p>
<p>WIGGINS And scores of adventures waiting for us, right, Percy? Do you think we'll meet some savages?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE If we do, we should be sure to give them a proper English greeting.</p>
<p>WIGGINS Oh, gift baskets!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE And he came so highly recommended.</p>
<p>[John Smith enters.]</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep enough, we can pull right up to shore. Hey there, Percy.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Very well, then. Give the order.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Already done, sir. I've got a crew assembled and they're ready to go.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE About the natives, I'm counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Right. That'll be all, Smith, there's a good man.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH See ya, Percy.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE The men like Smith, don't they? I've never been a popular man.</p>
<p>WIGGINS I like you.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE And don't think I don't know what those backstabbers at court say about me.</p>
<p>WIGGINS Oh yes, all that talk about you being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything he's&mdash;</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory. But mark my words, Wiggins, when King James see the gold these peasants unearth success will be mine, at last.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, on deck, Susan Constant.]</p>
<p>BEN Wake up! Shake a leg!</p>
<p>LON It's incredible.</p>
<p>THOMAS And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>BEN It can look like Ratcliffe's knickers, for all I care, just as long as we get off this stinking boat.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Come on, men, we didn't come all this way just to look at it.</p>
<p>[They row ashore as Pocahontas watches.]</p>
<p>BEN Keep it taut, lads, keep it taut! Steady, steady.</p>
<p>LON Ah, that's far enough! All right now, tie her off.</p>
<p>THOMAS Here, John, tie up this end. John? John? What are you doing up there?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Getting a better look. [Meeko bumps into him.] Hey! Well, you're a strange-looking fellow. You hungry? Here you go, it's a biscuit. It's food&hellip; Well, sort of. You like it, eh? Well, try eating it for four months straight. You got a friend back there? [Flit attacks him.] Hey, what, what, watch out! No&hellip; Get that&hellip; Look out!</p>
<p>THOMAS John! You better get down here! The Governor's coming ashore!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH All right, all right, I'm leaving.</p>
<p>[Transition to: Interior, Powhatan camp.]</p>
<p>NATIVE AMERICAN Did you see their skin? Pale and sickly.</p>
<p>NATIVE AMERICAN They have hair on their faces like dogs.</p>
<p>POWHATAN My brothers, we must know more about these visitors. Kekata, what do you see?</p>
<p>KEKATA [Chanting.] These are not men like us, but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun and weapons that spout fire and thunder. They prowl the earth like ravenous wolves consuming everything in their path.</p>
<p>KOCOUM Great Powhatan. I will lead our warriors to the river and attack. We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy, but these pale visitors are strange to us. Take some men to the river to observe them. Let us hope they do not intend to stay.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, English settlement, day.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE I hereby claim this land and all its riches in the name of His Majesty King James the first, and do so name this settlement Jamestown.</p>

<p>RATCLIFFE Captain Smith! It appears I've selected the perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Well then, perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts, hmm?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.</p>

<p>BEN &amp; LON Digging?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Why, of course! Let's not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World. Gold, mountains of it. Why, for years they've been ravaging the New World of its most precious resources but now&hellip; It's our turn. The gold of Cort&eacute;z The jewels of Pizarro Will seem like mere trinkets By this time tomorrow The gold we find here Will dwarf them by far Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys Dig up Virginia, boys Mine, boys, mine, every mountain And dig, boys, dig til ya drop Grab a pick, boys Quick, boys Shove in a shovel Uncover those lovely Pebbles that sparkle and shine It's gold And it's mine, mine, mine</p>

<p>POCAHONTAS Meeko!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Well, how do you do, Meeko? It's all right, it's just a handshake. Here, let me show you.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Nothing's happening.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No, no, I need your hand first. It's how we say hello.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS This is how we say hello. Wingapo.</p>

<p>JOHN SMITH I like hello better. [Flit charges at him.] Yeah, I remember you.</p>

<p>JOHN SMITH No, no, it's all right. He can keep it. Call it a gift.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What was that?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH My compass.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Compass?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH It tells you how to find your way when you get lost. But it's all right, I'll get another one in London.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS London? Is that your village?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Yes, it's a very big village.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What's it like?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Well, it's got streets filled with carriages and bridges over the rivers and buildings as tall as trees.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I'd like to see those things.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH You will.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS How?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH We're going to build them here. We'll show your people how to use this land properly. How to make the most of it.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Make the most of it?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Yes, we'll build roads and decent houses and&mdash;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Our houses are fine.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH You think that, only because you don't know any better. [Pocahontas starts to leave.] Wait a minute, don't take it that &ndash; [Flit attacks him.] Hey, hey, wait! Wait, wait! There's so much we can teach you. We've improved the lives of savages all over the world.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Savages?!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Uh, not that you're a savage.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Just my people.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No, listen, that's not what I meant. Let me explain&mdash;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Let go!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No, I'm not letting you leave. Look, don't do this. Savage' is just a word. You know. A term for&hellip; people who are uncivilized.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Like me.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is &ndash; is&hellip;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What you mean is, not like you. You think I'm an ignorant savage And you've been so many places, I guess it must be so But still I cannot see If the savage one is me How can there be so much that you don't know? You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on The earth is just a dead thing you can claim But I know every rock and tree and creature Has a life, has a spirit, has a name You think the only people who are people Are the people who look and think like you But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger You'll learn things you never knew you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue-corn moon? Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned? Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain? Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth Come roll in all the riches all around you And for once, never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers The heron and the otter are my friends And we are all connected to each other In a circle, in a hoop that never ends How high does the sycamore grow? If you cut it down, then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue-corn moon For whether we are white or copper-skinned We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the earth and still All you'll own is earth until You can paint with all the colors of the wind JOHN SMITH What is it?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS The drums. They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I want to see you again.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I can't.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Please, don't leave.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I'm sorry. I have to go.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Jamestown, dark rainy day.]</p>
<p>BEN All right! This one's ready to hoist!</p>
<p>LON Two on each side. Ready now, push! Watch it, it's slipping!</p>
<p>BEN Come on, lads, it's only a little picket fence.</p>
<p>LON Steady, steady!</p>
<p>BEN There you go!</p>
<p>THOMAS That'll keep everything out, eh, John? Something wrong, John?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH What?</p>
<p>THOMAS You've been awfully quiet the last few days.</p>
<p>LON Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action.</p>
<p>THOMAS Ah, don't worry, John. You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.</p>
<p>LON Yeah, we'll take care of them like that we did last time, eh mates? We shot ourselves an Injun Or maybe two or three</p>
<p>BEN All right, you howling nutter, get to work!</p>
<p>LON Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.</p>
<p>BEN Oh sure, we're having loads of fun. Right, look at us. No gold, no food, while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day happy as a clam.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Interior, Ratcliffe's tent.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE I'm doomed! I should be wallowing in riches right now and I haven't seen so much as a speck! It's got to be here somewhere. Where could it be? I've mined the forests and the hills and swamps, and nothing! Why can't I find it? What am I overlooking?</p>
<p>WIGGINS Ah!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE [Gasp.]</p>
<p>WIGGINS I&hellip; I&hellip; I made it myself.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Take that silly&hellip; Of course, the Indians! Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?</p>
<p>WIGGINS Because we invaded their land and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE It's the gold! They have it and they don't want us to take it from them. Well, I'll just have to take it by force then, won't I?</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Jamestown settlement.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE You there! Where's Captain Smith?</p>
<p>LON Well, he's&hellip; gone!</p>
<p>BEN Aye, your singing must have scared him off.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake!</p>
<p>LON What if we run into the Indians?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE That's what guns are for, now arm yourselves and get moving!</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Powhatan corn field, day.]</p>
<p>POWHATAN Pocahontas! You should be inside the village.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS We'll be all right.</p>
<p>NAKOMA We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Don't go far. Now is not the time to be running off.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Yes, father.</p>
<p>POWHATAN When I see you wear that necklace, you look just like your mother.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I miss her.</p>
<p>POWHATAN But she is still with us. Whenever the wind blows through the trees, I feel her presence. Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength. Someday, they will look to you as well.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I would be honored by that.</p>
<p>POWHATAN You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll send for Kocoum. [Exits.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA All right, what is it?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What?</p>
<p>NAKOMA You're hiding something.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I'm not hiding anything.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas, you can tell me, I promise I won't tell anyone &mdash;</p>
<p>[John Smith enters.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA [Gasp.] Pocahontas, look! It's one of them! I'm going to get&mdash; [Pocahontas covers her mouth.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What are you doing here?</p>
<p>NAKOMA Mmm?!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I had to see you again.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Mmm!</p>
<p>KOCOUM Pocahontas!</p>
<p>NAKOMA Mmm!</p>
<p>KOCOUM Pocahontas!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Please, don't say anything. Quick, this way.</p>
<p>NAKOMA But&mdash;</p>
<p>[Pocahontas and John exit.]</p>
<p>KOCOUM Nakoma, where is Pocahontas?</p>
<p>NAKOMA I&hellip; I haven't seen her.</p>
<p>KOCOUM Pocahontas can't keep running off. It's dangerous out there. Tell her that. She listens to you.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Huh, sure she does.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Grandmother Willow's glen, day.]</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH This place is incredible! And to think, we came all this way just to dig it up for gold.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Gold?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Hey, Meeko.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What's gold?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH You know, it's&hellip; It's yellow, comes out of the ground, it's really valuable.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Oh, here, we've lots of it. [Takes out an ear of corn.] Gold.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No&hellip; Gold is this. [Takes out a gold coin.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Hmm, there's nothing like that around here.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No gold?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Not that I've seen.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH [Laughs.] All this way for nothing. Those boys are in for a big surprise.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Will they leave?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Some of them might.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Will you go home?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to. I've never really belonged anywhere.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS You could belong here.</p>
<p>WIND SPIRIT Ay ay ay na ay ay na&hellip;</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH What was that?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Did you see something?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No&hellip; No, I just, uh&hellip; I&hellip; I didn't see anything. Did I?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Look again.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Let it break upon you Like a wave upon the sand Hello, John Smith.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Pocahontas, the tree is talking to me.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Then you should talk back.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Don't be frightened, young man. My bark is worse than my bite.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Say something.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH What do you say to a tree?</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Anything you want.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH So, uh&hellip;</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Come closer, John Smith. He has a good soul. And he's handsome, too.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Oh, I like her.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I knew you would.</p>
<p>BEN (off-screen) Smith! Smith! Where are ya, mate?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH We can't let them see us.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Quick, over here.</p>
<p>LON This place gives me the creeps. Savages could be hiding anywhere.</p>
<p>BEN Aye, well, if you spot one, don't ask questions. Just shoot.</p>
<p>[Grandmother Willow trips them.]</p>
<p>BEN &amp; LON Oh!</p>
<p>BEN Watch your feet, you big oaf!</p>
<p>LON It wasn't me, it was the tree.</p>
<p>BEN Oh of course, the tree just felt like lifting its roots and&hellip; Let's get out of here. Run!</p>
<p>LON But what about Smith?</p>
<p>BEN He's a big lad, he can take care of himself.</p>
<p>[Lon and Ben exit.]</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I'm glad you're on our side.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW There's still some snap in these old vines.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS When will I see you again?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Meet me tonight, right here. [Exits.]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Well, I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again. I mean, I want to see him again&mdash;</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Perhaps it's your dream.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS My dream? Do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Mm-hmm!</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Powhatan village, sunset.]</p>
<p>NATIVE AMERICAN The warriors are here!</p>
<p>[Pocahontas arrives.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with that&mdash;</p>
<p>KOCOUM There you are!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Kocoum!</p>
<p>KOCOUM Look at them. Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons!</p>
<p>POWHATAN Now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy.</p>
<p>[Pocahontas runs to her father.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Father, I need to speak with you.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS We don't have to fight them! There must be a better way.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But maybe we should try talking to them.</p>
<p>POWHATAN They do not want to talk.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>POWHATAN Pocahontas&mdash;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Wouldn't you?</p>
<p>POWHATAN Of course I would. But it is not that simple. Nothing is simple anymore.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Jamestown, sunset.]</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Easy, Thomas. It's me.</p>
<p>THOMAS Oh, John! I could've killed you!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Not aiming like that, you couldn't. Keep both eyes open when you shoot. You'll see twice as well.</p>
<p>BEN Smith! There ya are!</p>
<p>LON We were looking all over for you.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Smith! Where have you been?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I was out scouting the terrain, sir.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts. We'll need that information for the battle.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH What battle?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE We will eliminate these savages once and for all.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH No! You can't do that! RATCLIFFE Oh? Can't I?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Look, we don't have to fight them.</p>
<p>THOMAS John, what's gotten into you?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH I met one of them.</p>
<p>BEN You what?</p>
<p>THOMAS A savage?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH They're not savages, they can help us. They know the land, they know how to navigate the rivers. And, look! It's food!</p>
<p>LON What is it?</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.</p>
<p>WIGGINS I like gruel.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE They don't want to feed us, you ninnies! They want to kill us! All of us! They've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH But there is no gold!</p>
<p>BEN No&hellip; gold?</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Yes.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Lies! Lies, all of it! Murderous thieves, there's no room for their kind in civilized society.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH But this is their land!</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE This is my land! I make the laws here. And I say anyone so much as looks at an Indian without killing him on sight, will be tried for treason and hanged.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Powhatan village, night.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Nakoma!</p>
<p>NAKOMA Don't go out there. I lied for you once, don't ask me to do it again.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I have to do this.</p>
<p>NAKOMA He's one of them!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS You don't know him.</p>
<p>NAKOMA You go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I'm trying to help my people.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas, please&hellip; You're my best friend, I don't want you to get hurt.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I won't, I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas, no!</p>
<p>[Cut to: Exterior, Jamestown settlement, night.]</p>
<p>BEN &hellip; Ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothing.</p>
<p>LON But what if Smith is right? What if there is no gold?</p>
<p>ENGLISHMAN If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.</p>
<p>BEN Listen to you, you bunch of idiots. Those savages didn't attack us for nothing, they're hiding something.</p>
<p>LON If they do have the gold, I reckon we'll have to fight them.</p>
<p>[Thomas follows John to the edge of the settlement.]</p>
<p>THOMAS [Gasp.]</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE Follow him.</p>
<p>THOMAS Yes, Governor.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE I want to know where he's sneaking off to.</p>
<p>THOMAS Yes, sir.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them. Oh, and Thomas? You've been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier. Don't disappoint me again.</p>
<p>[Cut to: Interior, Kocoum's tent.]</p>
<p>NAKOMA Kocoum?</p>
<p>KOCOUM What is it?</p>

<p>POCAHONTAS The warriors are here!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Pocahontas!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS John!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people. You've got to warn them.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Maybe it's not too late to stop this. You have to come with me and talk to my father.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good. I already tried talking to my men but everything about this land has them spooked.</p>
<p>[Percy enters.]</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW That's the strangest creature I've ever seen!</p>
<p>[Percy chases Meeko.]</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Percy! Easy, Percy, come here!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Meeko, come back!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Come, come here!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH It's all right, he's a friend. Bad, bad dog! Sit!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS What are you doing? Meeko!</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Percy, get back here! Stop that!</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW All right, that's enough! It's enough to make your sap boil. Now then, there's something I want to show you. Look. [Touches a vine to the river surface.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS The ripples.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH What about them?</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW So small at first, then look how they grow. But someone has to start them.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH They're not going to listen to us.</p>
<p>GRANDMOTHER WILLOW Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one. Don't you see, only when the fighting stops can you can be together.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH All right, let's go talk to your father.</p>
<p>[Pocahontas and John embrace, then kiss. Kocoum and Thomas are watching.]</p>

<p>POWHATAN Who did this?</p>
<p>NATIVE AMERICAN WARRIOR Pocahontas was out in the woods. Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked them.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Your weapons are strong. But now our anger is stronger. At sunrise he will be the first to die!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS But father!</p>
<p>POWHATAN I told you to stay in the village. You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father!</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I was only trying to help.</p>
<p>POWHATAN Because of your foolishness, Kocoum is dead! Take him away. [Exits.]</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS Kocoum was just coming to protect me.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you. I was worried about you. I thought I was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS All of this happened because of me&hellip; And now I'll never see John Smith again.</p>
<p>NAKOMA Come with me.</p>

<p>POCAHONTAS I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH For what, this? I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this. Can't think of any right now, but&hellip;</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS It would've been better if we'd never met, none of this would've happened.</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Pocahontas, look at me. I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you. If I never knew you If I never felt this love I would have no inkling of How precious life can be If I never held you I would never have a clue How at last I'd find in you The missing part of me In this world so full of fear Full of rage and lies I can see the truth so clear In your eyes So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you I'd have lived my whole life through Lost forever, if I never knew you</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night But still my heart is saying we were right For if I never knew you</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH There's no moment I regret</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS If I never knew this love</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH Since the moment that we met</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS I would have no inkling of</p>
<p>JOHN SMITH If our time has gone too fast</p>
<p>POCAHONTAS How precious life can be</p>

<p>RATCLIFFE It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't have planned this better myself. The gold is as good as mine!</p>
<p>THOMAS We've got to save him! He'd do the same for any of us.</p>
<p>BEN Thomas is right! We've got to do something.</p>
<p>RATCLIFFE And so we shall! I told you those savages couldn't be trusted. Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him. But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade. At daybreak, we attack! What can you expect From filthy little heathens Here's what you get when races are diverse Their skin's a hellish red They're only good when dead They're vermin as they said and worse They're</p>
